dEEd was founded in 2007, when we merged two bands into one. We were inspired by bands like QotSA and wanted to create rough, dirty post grunge. We recorded some of the many songs we wrote, but until I get them up here, you can watch a short live clip [here]({{youtube-me}}).

I left dEEd in 2008, as I became a dad, but they kept on playing with a new, great vocalist - Emma Fredriksson. They released an EP called [Starfucker]({{starfucker}}) in 2010 and played a bunch of shows. You can watch some of their live performances [here]({{youtube}}).
