I joined Rakveres in 2001. We started off covering bands like Weezer, Danzig and Nirvana, but soon begun writing our own songs, of which four were recorded.

Rakveres was a really fun band to play in, the first that I didn't take too serious. Still, it was the band with which I wrote one of the best songs that I've ever written. 'Sweet Girls' was written on a boring boat trip between Estonia and Sweden, as we tried to kill boredom with beer. It worked.
