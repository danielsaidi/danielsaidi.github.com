I joined Rakveres in 2001. We started off covering bands like Weezer, Danzig and Nirvana, but soon begun writing our own songs, of which four were recorded.

Rakveres was a really fun band to play in and the band with which I wrote one of my best songs. 'Sweet Girls' was written on a boring boat trip between Estonia and Sweden, as we tried to kill boredom with beer. It worked.
