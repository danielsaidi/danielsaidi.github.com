I formed Eblis in 1999 and was lucky to get the insanely talented Victor Larsson and Tomas Modin to join. In the studio, we got help from many talented friends, which made our studio times very special and creative. One time, 'Idol Enslaved' producer Magnus Ventinen said "I'll be back" and disappeared for several hours, just to return with an old Hammond organ in mint condition. He though it would sound great in one of the songs. It did.
