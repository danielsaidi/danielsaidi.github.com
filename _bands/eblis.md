I formed Eblis in 1999 and was lucky to get the insanely talented Victor Larsson and Tomas Modin to join. In the studio, we got help from many local talents. This made the studio sessions very special and fun.

A golden memory was when we recorded 'Idol Enslaved' with Magnus Ventinen. Suddenly, Magnus disappeared for hours, just to return with an old Hammond in mint condition. He though it would sound great. It did.
