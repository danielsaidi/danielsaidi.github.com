I started Saidi och Kollektivet in 2001, after writing Swedish pop/rock songs on my own for a couple of years. The first lineup in autum 2001 was small, with me and Lars Forsell trying out some songs with a couple of drummers and basists, wuthout reaching a final result.

The second lineup was formed in autumn 2002 and recorded one demo before many of us went travelling or studying abroad. Ater that, members varied with a solid code. We released four demos and performed a lot, but decided to stop in 2007, since living in several cities made it hard to stick together. It was a great time, thanks to everyone involved.
