I sang in Misfortune between 1995 and 1999. After the first Pantera-influenced demo, we tuned in on bands like At the Gates, Carcass and Dissection. As a result, the second demo differed a lot from the first.

"Midnightenlightened" received great reviews and was eventually released as an EP by Blackened / Plastic Head. Shortly after, we begun working on the fullength album.

"Forsaken" was released in 1999. The recording suffered from many technical problems. As a result, the songs became quite flat, which is a shame, since they were initially wildly decorated.
