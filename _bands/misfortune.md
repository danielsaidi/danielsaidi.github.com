I sang in Misfortune between 1995 and 1999. We started off as a Pantera-influenced band, butsoon tuned in on bands like At the Gates, Carcass and Dissection. As a result, the second demo differed a lot from the first.

"Midnightenlightened" received great reviews and was released as an EP by Blackened / Plastic Head. Shortly after, we begun working on [Forsaken]({{page.forsaken}}), which was released in 1999. The recording suffered from technical problems, which made the songs flat compared to the well composed guitar pieces that Martin and Peter had originally written.
