I sang in Misfortune between 1995 and 1999. We started off as a Pantera-influenced band, but soon tuned in to bands like At the Gates, Carcass and Dissection and alterered our sound accordingly. As a result, the second demo sounded a lot different than the first.

The second demo - "Midnightenlightened" - received very good reviews and was released as an EP by Blackened / Plastic Head as part of our record deal with them. Our first and only full-length album - [Forsaken]({{page.forsaken}}) - was released in 1999, but the suffered from technical problems that made the songs flat compared to the original arrangements we had in mind.
