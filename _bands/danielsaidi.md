I have always loved music and have written songs since I was a kid. I started my first band at age 15 and recorded [my first EP]({{page.midnightenlightened}}) at age 19. I have played everything from pop to rock, punk and more extreme metal. I've done vocals in all bands, and played guitars in some.

I played more or less constantly from 1995 to 2008, but after becoming a father in late 2008, I decided to stop playing in bands and now only write music and play for the fun of it, whenever I feel like it. The music I write and record on my own is guitar-based and kept pretty basic.
