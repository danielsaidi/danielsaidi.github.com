I sang in sgt. Black between 2001 and 2004. During this time, we changed name and lineup twice.

The first lineup (New Wave Stoner) was founded in 2001. Many songs were written, but none were recorded. The second (x:o) was formed as Max switched to drums and Olof joined on guitars.

The final lineup (sgt. Black) was identical to x:o, with a slight change of musical direction. We wrote a bunch of songs, recorded nine of them, and performed at many clubs.
