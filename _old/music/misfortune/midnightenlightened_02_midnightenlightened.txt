Midnightenlightened
===================

Leaping through the forest, aching under the moon
It’s beams force my body to grow to a shadow
Of my former self, the one I once was
I can feel a howl grow in my throat

Dead - the animal in my arms
I didn’t mean no harm,
but still I smashed it to the ground,
dug a hole in it’s throat
and let my teeth slip inside
and as it shivered I feasted on it’s flesh
Leaving the path I walked along
This body don’t belong to a human anymore
Inner temptations have finally broken through
I’m erasing the last remains of man

I still can’t remember receiving this curse
I’ve repressed the memories deep inside
The sins of my fathers live on in my blood
The concretion of two minds hurts

Fear - as I’m falling to the ground
A sudden shock of pain
without an inflictor in sight
Inner emotions like sharp razor knives,
as the man struggles on to break free
Once again
The dance of the beast -
a beautiful sight in the moonenlightened night

Inner chaos, mind to mind
The instincts of beast
against the reason of man

The dance continues along paths in the woods
The man-shape now weaker than ever
At midnight it stops with a grin on it’s face
Rising it’s arms, greeting the haze

Man forever gone,
locked up inside for evermore

By dusk embraced, I leave no trace
Black as night, out of sight
