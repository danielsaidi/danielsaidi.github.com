I sang in Misfortune between 1995 and 1999.

After the first, Pantera-influenced demo, we found inspiration in bands like At the Gates, Carcass, Dissection etc. As a natural result, the second demo - "Midnightenlightened" - differed a lot from the first.

"Midnightenlightened" received great reviews and was eventually picked up by Blackened / Plastic Head, which released it as an EP. Shortly after, we begun working on the fullength album "Forsaken", which was released in 1999.

The recording of "Forsaken" suffered from many technical issues. As a result, the songs (which should have been widely decorated) became quite flat and...boring. It's a shame, but I still hear the songs as they were intended to sound.
