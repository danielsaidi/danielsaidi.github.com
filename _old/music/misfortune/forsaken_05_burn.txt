Burn!
=====

Set ablaze in the night
The full moon is rising,
enlightening the sky
My skin gets charred as I burn,
but my thoughts are dedicated to the past

The flames burn my eyes,
won’t allow me to die
It’s hard to see what is real,
so hard to feel
Nailed up at this mountainside,
far from home
I search inside for a place to hide

But now I see through the lies,
through my melted eyes
Flames set me free,
burn this shell and allow me to drift away

I gave to myself
what was meant for their lord
Couldn’t find any sense in their belief
I defiled their church
by the nature of my belief
and as I burn I scream in the night 
I held the truth they couldn’t handle
Now I’m punished for their sins,
but as I burn I still know that I’m right
I'm set ablaze in the night

As the morning arrives,
the sun is rising,
enlightening the sky
Been dead since long,
but still my soul is free
I’m moving on

Below me I see the people I will
swear my revenge upon
A baptism of fire, in fire, in flames
I’m fulfilling what they begun

They’ve defiled their church
by their unholy deeds
And as they burn I laugh in the sunlight 
I hold the truth they cannot handle,
now they’re punished for their sins
and as they burn they will know that I’m right
Set ablaze in the sunlight

Burn!
