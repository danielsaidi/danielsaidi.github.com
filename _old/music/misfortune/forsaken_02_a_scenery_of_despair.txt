A Scenery of Despair
====================

A silent wind caresses my cheek
like a fatherly hand stretched out
and the shadows flutter in fading light
They're alive,
as hatred breeds in the twilight sky

A beautiful scenery of despair,
a mystic act of the purest grief
is coming alive in the madness of night
I'm dazzled by secrets the darkness dwells

Once again I witness this play
of souls crying out in pain
A fruitless search in the wildest of dreams
to wash away the bloodstains
They die over and over again

Once immortal, brave men
now wander the earth in confusion
in a quest for answer to their grief
It's all a part of the nocturnal theatre

A painful act of misery
In a mist of madness they hide
Winds of grief - carry them on
through their darkest secrets
Screams of horror echo long
throughout the tormenting darkness

A beautiful scenery of despair,
a mystic act of the purest grief
is coming alive in the madness of night
I'm dazzled by secrets the darkness dwells
