	"biography" : [
		"I sang in Misfortune between 1995 and 1999. After the first Pantera-influenced demo, we tuned in on bands like At the Gates, Carcass and Dissection. As a result, the second demo differed a lot from the first.",
		"'Midnightenlightened' received great reviews and was eventually released as an EP by Blackened / Plastic Head. Shortly after, we begun working on the fullength album.",
		"'Forsaken' was released in 1999. The recording suffered from many technical problems. As a result, the songs became quite flat and (to be frank) boring. It's a shame, since they were initially wildly decorated."
