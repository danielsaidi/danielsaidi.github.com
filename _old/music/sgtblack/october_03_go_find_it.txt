Go Find It
==========

Once more the green
sends shivers down her spine
A key to life slips inside
So, now she’s kneeling like before -
dressed down/up as the best of whores
Her pockets bleed, but money wins

She wants to buy what still is his
He once said “You too deserve this”
He said “Remember that”

But that was then
and now is fucking now
Blue-pounded skin is giving up
So, now she is kneeling like before -
dressed down/up as the best of whores
So sick of bleeding in his place

Once she was looked at from below,
although that dream is gone forever now
He said: “Remember this, now go find it
You’re not meant for this, go find it”
He said: “Remember that, go find it”

Still, once more the green
sends shivers down her spine
She closes her eyes as he slips inside
So, now she is kneeling like before
dressed down/up, still the queen of whores
He said: “Get used to bleed
cause I don’t need you anymore”

She will return to what still is his,
cause he once said that she deserved it
She’s not meant for this,
not meant for anything
Go find it
