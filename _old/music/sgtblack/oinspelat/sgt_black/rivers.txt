Rivers
======

Your rivers -
cutting through mascara lines like knives
Your rivers -
this is what our lives should be like

I want to be absorbed,
want to come into you now
I want to be absorbed,
want to flow right through you now

Your tongue -
dancing on my skin,
donâ€™t let the light in
Your tongue -
this is how a new life should begin

I want to be absorbed,
want to come into you now
I want to be absorbed,
want to flow right through you now

My rivers -
exploding as the light goes white
My rivers -
exploding as our lives grow twice

I want to be absorbed,
want to come into you now
I want to be absorbed,
want to flow right through you now
