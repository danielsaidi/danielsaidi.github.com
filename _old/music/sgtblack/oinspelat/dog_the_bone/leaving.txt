Leaving
=======

We couldn’t see it coming
as we ploughed our way through life
Concentrating on a better sale,
closing deals just to feel alive

“You’re not living - leaving”

He always claimed that this was wrong,
but in vain
Cause we were already gone,
growing grey
Laid down our dreams without a fight,
souls for sale
Turned old over a night

Too late he saw it coming,
searched deeper in our eyes
For something to be saved
before we kissed our lives goodbye

“You’re not leaving - stay with me”

He said he’d stop the rain,
and we smiled
Cause to us he was enchained,
lost in life
He claimed we changed so suddenly,
growing blind
That we’re not who we used to be

He said:
“It’s like you’re living in Atlantis”
But why?
He said:
“You’re living your Atlantis-lives,
but you’ll see, you’ll see,
that one day you will awake
as you’re plunging into the sea”
