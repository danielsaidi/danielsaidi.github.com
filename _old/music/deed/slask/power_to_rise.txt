Power to Rise
=============

<vers>

Watch me now...raising a leg
Watch me now...blazing away

<vers>

Watch me now...raising a leg
Watch me now...blazing away

Without power...I am still
But with power...I move at will
With electric magic into my spine
every inch of me is starting to move
xxxx

Twist and shake me...I've got the power
Twist and quake me...I've got the power
