	"biography" : [
		"I joined Rakveres 2001. We started off playing covers of Weezer, Danzig, Nirvana etc., but soon begun writing our own stuff, of which four were recorded.",
		"Rakveres was a really fun band to play in, since it was not that dead serious. Still, 'Sweet Girls' is one of the best songs I have ever written. We wrote it on a booooring boat trip between Estonia and Sweden, as we tried to kill the boredom with a case of beer. It worked."
