Once
====

Once again I watch it break,
one inch too far away
I feel it's pace pound my chest
It just won't let me rest

I tried so hard to hide away
from my endless days
"Hey, stay in shape
You're doing fine,
the sales are fine"
Hell, is this life?

I can't change the system from within
I wanna dive so far away

Once again I watch it…
…not break
It's just an instant moment of fear
Don't caress me

I tried so hard to smile away
from each lonely day
I cannot stop this final time
Hell, is this life?
Was I alive?

I don't want it, but can't change it
This final second echoes on
I regret it, but can't change it
This final second echoes on
