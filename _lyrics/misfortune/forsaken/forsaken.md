name: Forsaken

Your blindfolded reality soon will cease,
so shred out your blind eyes
and see the true face of the world -
your reality repulsively combined
with this chaotic insanity

We were the bended minds
concealed to mankind
Minds will collapse
during this infection of reality

This is the time
when your guardian angels burn
and the forests open up
for the living earth

We were taken to utter not a word -
humiliated and forsaken
They knew it all -
fed our minds with fear
for the barrier to fall

Eternal time contorts
what has never been taken place
Live to accept,
accept to forget,
forget to live

They are the voices
that leave no choices -
our darkest visions impersonated

We were taken to utter not a word -
tormented and forsaken
We saw it all
Involuntarily we razed the barrier

We've seen it before,
we've known it ever since
we became old enough to understand
They have always been close,
sharing glimpses of the future,
twisting truth into the biggest of lies
A legend now brought to life,
as we inject the visions
they want us to see
But why,
why did I have to be granted this gift?

It's all a lie

Creates of the mind -
bring forth the truth
since long forgotten!
Schizophrenia is brought
into another level

They are the voices
that leave no choices -
our darkest visions impersonated

We were taken to utter not a word -
abused and forsaken
They knew it all,
but who will protect them now,
when their reality falls
