title: Cold Hearts
---

Thought that life was free
for those who tried,
but the price is getting higher
by the minute
Still, we push our luck too far,
unaware that we may push it
to the limit

Life won't start in cold hearts

I made myself a promise not to cry,
but the doubt inside
was more than I could handle
What chance have we
if life won't come our way
and love must be tricked out
with living candles?

Light goes out, time runs out
Life won't start in cold hearts

Taught as kids that nothing’s free
Taught to become
what others want us to be,
And not to say what we want
when we want to,
cause we’re always wrong
Have to find out for ourselves
from the start
where to belong

Light goes out,
time runs out
Life won't start
in cold hearts

Teach our kids that nothing’s free
Tell them to become
what we want them to be
And not to say what they want
when they want to,
cause they’re always wrong
Have to find out for themselves
from the start
where to belong

Night comes down,
light goes out
Life won't start
in cold hearts
