title: Itch
---

Within I’m without,
cold loss is coming down
Itch one, ache three,
through all you covered me in

Hate me, and so join me
It’s a feeling deep inside,
not to be real
and I wish to burn it away,
to burn it all away
so this feeling through my eyes
will slowly leave me

Breath in, spit out,
those words you love to shout
Itch one, ache three,
so useless, cease to breath

Blame me, if it makes it easy
It’s a feeling deep inside,
that your anger is real
and I wish to burn it away,
to burn it all away
so a feeling of total night
will slowly leave me

Shame on me,
I don’t deserve to bleed,
but a feeling deep inside
is slowly craving to come out
and I wish to burn it away,
to burn it all away
It is time to kill the light
and count me in
