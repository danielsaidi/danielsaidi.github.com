title: Shake It Off
---

How long 'til this is over with,
how long 'til all is said and done?
Never asked to be the one to take you down
I fear that something still
lives inside
and keeps this wheel spinning 'til
we've both been crucified

No, I don't want to be a storm in your head,
to be blamed for living
I don't want to be a fucking storm in your head,
won't let this thing get out of hand

The tears that fall for me,
I've learned to despise
Fall to blame for things not done,
I can't make this sacrifice

I shake it off of me,
won't you also do it, do it please?
I shake you off of me,
won't you forget about me, do it please?
I shake it off of me,
won't you also do it, do it please?
It's not my responsibility
Let's get this over with now

Life goes down,
years gone now
Life goes down,
years gone

I don't want to be here,
all I am is just a storm in your head,
just blamed for living
I don't want to be a fucking storm in your head,
won't let this thing get out of hand

Shake it off, off, off

I shake it off of me,
won't you also do it, do it please?
I shake you off of me,
won't you forget about me, do it please?
I shake it off of me,
won't you also do it, do it please?
It's not my responsibility
Let's get this over with now
