Hanging on
==========

No, I’ve told you no
so many times that I know
that this won’t be easy,
I’d like it easy
So say, what to say?
I used to play games
to make it easy
to hate me, to blame me

But no, you just keep hanging on
It’s almost like our umbilical cords
are connected
through eternal days of boredom
Why won’t you let me leave you?

Stay, that’s all you say
Your eyes are facing away
and that ain’t easy
I need it easy
But no, you just keep hanging on

Go, it’s time to go,
but your lips are moving like:
“No, don’t do it please!
How may I please you?”
So manic it’s tragic
