title: One Blow to Shine
---

Six shadows wide,
as one with time
Seeks not to hide,
sin bears a smile
Six now in line,
lines in reply

If you think you’re strong enough,
then come, take me on
And if you think you know enough,
then push your luck, take me down
Yours is a line of tragedy
Retreat, retreat!
Soon just a line of what once been
Take me on, bring me down

Six now in line
return the crimes,
seeks not to shine
Sin bears a smile
Six down the line,
six join the count

Though that you were strong enough,
that you could take me on
Though that you knew enough,
pushed your luck, taken down
Yours is a line of tragedy
Retreat, retreat!
Now just a line of what once been
Take me on, bring me down

Six down the line
Sin bears a smile
Seeks not to hide
One blow to shine

One blow to shine
One blow to end this life
One blow to fly
One blow to…

If you think you’re strong enough,
then come, take us on
And if you think you know enough,
then push your luck, take us down
Yours is the line of tragedies
Retreat, retreat"
Soon just some lines of what once been
Take us on, bring us down
