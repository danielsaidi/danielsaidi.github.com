title: Let's End It All
---

Straight into the sun
Straight into where it all begun

Time made possible by the core
Time not plausible anymore

Let's penetrate the source of it all
Let's boost gravity
Let's bring time into a stall
Let's penetrate the source of it all
and end it all
Let's boost gravity
Let's make e=mc2 fall
Let's end it all

Straight, and then it's done
Straight, let's get it done

Life made possible by the core
Life not plausible anymore

Let's penetrate the source of it all
Let's boost gravity
Let's bring time into a stall
Let's penetrate the source of it all
and end it all
Let's boost gravity
Let's make e=mc2 fall
Let's end it all

It's time to make a stand
