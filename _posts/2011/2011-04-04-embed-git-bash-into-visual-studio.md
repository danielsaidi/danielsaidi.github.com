I have started using git with my private projects. It works really well, but I'm
having problems with how it integrates with Visual Studio.

Even though I use graphical tools like `TFS` and `AnkhSVN` for other versioning
systems, I do not like to work with git through Git Extensions. I prefer to use
the terminal when working with git in OS X, and that is the way I would like to
work with it when working with .NET and Visual Studio in Windows.

So, I therefore find it annoying to have the command prompt in a separate window
when working in Visual Studio, when IDE:s like Aptana Studio embeds it so well.
After a quick search, I found some people who found a solution to this problem
by embedding git in Visual Studio:

Hopefully this works well, so I can have my Git Bash bottommost in Visual Studio.
