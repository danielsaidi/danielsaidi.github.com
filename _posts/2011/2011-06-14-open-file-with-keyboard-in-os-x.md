Although I love OS X, I am still new to it and a Windows user at heart. As such,
the unintuitive and “secret club”-like keyboard shortcuts are not one of my most
favorite parts with it.

For instance, it took me a year to discover that I could press space to preview
files in Finder, with the preview software being one of the best I’ve ever used.
Why so obscure, Apple?

When I want to open files, I have been pressing the return key SO many times. It
means OPEN in Windows, but in OS X, it means RENAME. Here, I dare say that Apple
are the one who got it wrong.

So, I have been double-clicking files every time I have wanted to open them. The
thought never struck me, that there may be a shortcut to open files in Finder.

Today, though, I finally found that instead of hitting return, use this shortcut:

`cmd + down`

### cmd + down

## cmd + down !!!!!!!
