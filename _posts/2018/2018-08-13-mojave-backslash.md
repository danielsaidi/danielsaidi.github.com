I upgraded my computer to OSX Mojave a while back. Most things work really well,
but I have faced some strange keybinding issues with my Swedish keyboard.

One such thing is `backslash`, which in Mojave opens up the help menu instead of
typing that lovely tilted line that I want.

To restore the pre-Mojave behavior, open `Keyboard Settings` in `System Preferences`,
then select the `Shortcuts` tab, select `Application shortcuts` in the vertical
menu, then uncheck `Show help menu`:

After this, the standard Swedish backslash keybinding should work once again.
