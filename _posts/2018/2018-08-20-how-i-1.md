After years of development, I have come to a point where I'm very happy with my
iOS/Swift/Xcode setup, patterns, practices, toolbox etc. Since I have made many
conscious decisions about every big and small aspect of iOS app development for
such a long time, I think it may be time to write some of these things down in
hope that it may be of help to others as well. At the very least, it will serve
as self-reference of sorts.

I will take on this as an open process, where I'd love for you to reach out with
comments, suggestions, discussions, links to related blog posts, corrections etc. 
If you have any suggestions regarding this process idea, please let me know.

I plan to write one post each week. Given the varying complexity of the various
topics, the posts will range from short, concrete ones to longer, more abstract
ones. I will try to include hands-on information, code samples, screenshots and
maybe even links to GitHub example and demo repos.

The topics below is currently a top of mind brain dump. The list will evolve as
I proceed. As soon as a topic is written, I will link to that post in the list.

I used to love to blog about software development before becoming a parent and I
hope that this is a nice opportunity to return to writing. Keep in mind that the
topics are iOS/Swift/Xcode oriented, which I'll probably mention in the title of
each post.


## Topics

I have gone through most of my iOS projects and come up with some topics that I
would love to write about. Please let me know if you have any additional topics
that you would like to add.

 * Setting up a MacBook from scratch
 * Automating Xcode snippet management
 * iOS project structure
 * Splitting code into frameworks and libraries
 * Fastlane
 * CocoaPods
 * Carthage
 * IoC and Dependency Injection
 * Localization
 * Color assets
 * Image assets
 * Unit testing
 * Mocking
 * Alamofire + Codable
 * Protocol Driven Development
 * Decorator Pattern Magic
 * In-App Navigation
 * Message Handling
 * Notificatons
 * Extending protocol-based collections

As you can see, this list is pretty unstructured as of now, but I think that the
content of the posts is more important than the order if the list :)


## Conclusion

I look forward to getting started with this project and hope that you will keep
me company. I would love to hear what you think about what I have to say, so feel
free to reach out at any time.

All the best

Daniel Saidi
