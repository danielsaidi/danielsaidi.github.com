After years of development, I have come to a point where I am pretty happy with
my iOS & Swift setup, including project structure, code conventions, tools etc.
In this post, I'll discuss a series of posts that I plan to write, that descibe
this setup in detail.


## Why do I want to write these posts?

Since I have made so many decisions about every big and small aspect of iOS app
development for a long time, I want to write some of these things down, in hope
that it may be of help to others. If not, at least it will serve as self-reference.

I will take on this project as an open process, where I'd love for you to reach
out with comments, corrections, suggestions, links to related posts etc. If you
have any suggestions regarding this process idea, please let me know. I have no
writing schedule in mind, and will instead write whenever I feel like it.

The topics below is currently a top of mind brain dump. The list will evolve as
I proceed. As soon as a topic is written, I will link to that post in the list.


## Topics

I have gone through most of my iOS projects and come up with some topics that I
would like to write about:

### Getting started:

 * [Automate setting up your Mac]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018/2018-08-26-automate-setting-up-your-mac %})
 * [Automating setting up Xcode]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018/2018-11-05-automate-setting-up-xcode %})

### Project setup:

 * Setting up a new iOS project
 * Setting up dependency management with CocoaPods
 * Setting up dependency management with Carthage
 * Split up your code into frameworks and libraries
 * Automate everything from start using Fastlane

### Asset management:

 * Localization
 * Colors
 * Images
 * Fonts

### Code conventions and implementations:

 * IoC and Dependency Injection
 * Unit testing
 * Mocking
 * Alamofire + Codable
 * Protocol Driven Development

### Misc. topics:

 * In-App Navigation
 * Message Handling
 * Notificatons
 * Extending protocol-based collections

As you can see, the list is currently pretty unstructured. The pieces hopefully
fall into place as I proceed with the project :)


## Conclusion

I look forward to getting started with this project and hope that you will keep
me company. Feel free to reach out at any time.
