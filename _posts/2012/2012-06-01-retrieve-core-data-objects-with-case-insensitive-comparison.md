I am currently building an iOS app that uses core data for data persistency. All
works great, but as I started adding data and retrieved entities sorted by name,
I noticed that the sorting did not work as I expected. The objects came out in a
strange order:

* Object 1
* Object 3
* object 2

There is probably some case-sensitive sorting issue showing its ugly face, right.
This is the code I used to sort the data:

```objc
NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptor = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@"name" ascending:YES];
```


The solution was to add selector to the sort, like this:

```objc
NSSortDescriptor *sortDescriptor = [[NSSortDescriptor alloc] initWithKey:@"name" ascending:YES selector:@selector(caseInsensitiveCompare:)];
```

And voil√° - the list will now look like this:

* Object 1
* object 2
* Object 3
