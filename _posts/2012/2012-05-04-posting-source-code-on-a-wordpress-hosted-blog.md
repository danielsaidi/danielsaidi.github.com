As you probably have noticed, this is a code-oriented blog. Sicne I post a lot of code,
I have been annoyed for a long time, that the code has been terribly formatted.

The reason for this is that wordpress.com has some limitations when it comes to themes
and plugins. Since I have not yet found a good way to handle code here, I have wrapped
the code in pre tags and highlighted it with a distinct color, but the result has been
mediocre.

A couple of weeks ago, however, I found this blog post by the WordPress team. It turns
out that posting source code and getting it to format correctly is a walk in the park,
using the sourcecode markup, as such:

[code language=”css”]
your code here
[/code]

Use this markup, and WordPress will format the source code correctly. It supports many
different languages, e.g. C#, Java, JavaScript, CSS, XML etc. Have a look at [this blog
post](http://en.support.wordpress.com/code/posting-source-code/) for examples.

Thanks, WordPress!
