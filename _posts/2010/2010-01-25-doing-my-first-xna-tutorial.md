After looking at my friend Jens’ XNA game framework, which helps you get started
with XNA, I think I’d benefit from reading a tutorial or two before just using a
framework on top of XNA.

The game project type is quite different from the software I usually develop, so
I’d better read something before getting my hands dirty.

I will start with a Microsoft tutorial that helps you get a small 2D game up and
running, with a bouncing sprite:

After that, I will do some more tutorials with 3D models and a bit more advanced
functionality, before I continue my “which-I-thought-would-be-trivial" project.
