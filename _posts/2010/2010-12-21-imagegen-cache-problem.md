We will probably use ImageGen in a project that I'm currently working on. People
who have used it before really seem to like it, so I look forward to try it out.

However, the over one year old 2.0.1 release has a cache issue. This cache issue
is described in detail [here](http://our.umbraco.org/projects/website-utilities/imagegen/imagegen-bugs/2982-%5BUPDATE%5D-Fix-to-caching-bug-in-201).

The cache problem causes the cache folder to grow and grow, which perhaps is not
the best of things. The solution above involves downloading a file and replacing
parts of the 2.0.1 release.

Unfortunately, the file link is dead. After some searching, I found another copy
of the file. You can download it [here](http://www.hajslund.com/blog.aspx?filterby=ImageGen).

Thanks for posting it, Rasmus! ðŸ™‚
