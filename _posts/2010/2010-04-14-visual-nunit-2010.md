I have a license for R# at work. It's a really nice utility that helps me save a
lot of time. Besides providing a lot of shortcuts and extensions to Visual Studio,
it also integrates NUnit in a very convenient way.

I don't have R# at home, though, and really miss the NUnit integration. However,
I have found a workaround in the Visual NUnit 2010 extension for Visual Studio.
Visual NUnit provides a nice NUnit view, that can be embedded within Visual Studio.

Visual NUnit 2010 can be downloaded [here](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/c8164c71-0836-4471-80ce-633383031099).

After installing, you will find the Visual NUnit view under the View/Other views
menu alternative. If you do, you are good to go.

To make things even smoother, I have pinned the Visual NUnit view to the bottom
of Visual Stuio, which makes it instantly available as soon as I run my tests.
