I recently picked up my old, black beast from my basement, where it has lived in
solitude since I bought my Wii. Since it is *old* and much has happened with the
video game indistry since it came out, I don't game on my XBOX anymore. I use it
to play around with the XBOX MediaCenter software, instead. After upgrading XBMC
to the latest version, a friend of mine told me about XOT-Uzg, which is a script
that can be used to stream web TV.

After installing the script, I noticed how the wonders of the new world appeared
before me...as XOT-Uzg let me stream TV shows from Swedish channels as well. Now,
my 1 year old daugher is watching "In the Night Garden", streaming from SVT Play
on the XBOX. It is so smooth. If you have a chipped XBOX, try it out!

The only problems I have detected so far are:

* You can not pause for too long, or XOT-Uzg loses its connection
* You can not skip forward/back or fast-forward/backward

Also, make sure you are a paying customer of the TV services you decide to watch.
