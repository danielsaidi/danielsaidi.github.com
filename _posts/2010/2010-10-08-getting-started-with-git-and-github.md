As some of my hobby projects are coming together, I have meant to move them from
Google Code to GitHub for quite some time. Tonight, I decided to give it a try.

I first visited the [Git download page](http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/)
and downloaded the latest git release for OS X. Since configuring git involves a
couple of steps, I found [this page](http://help.github.com/mac-git-installation/)
really helpful. 

However, after installing git and getting the terminal ready, I soon found myself
entering commands into the terminal without any real understanding of what I was
doing. Pull? Fetch? Clone? What the hell is going on here? Guess I have a lot to
learn :)

Nevertheless, my hobby projects eventually ended up on GitHub and I now have the
best incentive ever to master git - do so or never see my source code ever again.
