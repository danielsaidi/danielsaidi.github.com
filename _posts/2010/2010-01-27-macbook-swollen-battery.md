I have previously written about my numerous problems with my new, white MacBook,
which I purchased in August 2007. For instance:

* the fan roared like a truck
* the audio port shone with a red light and thought that I had plugged in an optical device (which I had not)
* the audio port enabling optical mode turned of all sounds from the internal speaker
* the chassi cracked(!)
* the color wheel of death appeared every now and then, freezing the computer
* the computer stopped waking up from sleep
* the computer stopped recognizing my hard drive and displayed a ? when booting up

Fortunately, I documented all these problems with pictures and videos while they
were happening and wrote a long issue report. When the last problem occured, the
report proved very handy. The support person I sent the computer to doubted that
I would get the errors accepted as a reclamation, but as I handed him the report,
he said that it improved my chances drastically.

And so it did...obviously, since I got the computed repaired. After that, it has
worked like a charm. That is, until the battery did swell up. I didn't notice it
at first, but after a small bump in the battery, things quickly became worse.

Before I knew it, the battery stood out quite a bit from the computer. Apple did
NOT accept this complaint, so I had to buy a new one. I luckily found a reseller
that sold unofficial batteries for half the price, which is probably why the new
battery did not work as I had hoped.

I will write about this in the next entry...the green/orange color toggle problem.
