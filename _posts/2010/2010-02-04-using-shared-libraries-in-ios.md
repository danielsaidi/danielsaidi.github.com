After a couple of evenings, my first (really simple) iPhone app is taking shape.
However, since I am a .NET developer at heart, it is painfully clear how spoiled
I have become by all amazing Visual Studio features.

Some things that are natural and so easy to accomplish in .NET, does not come so
natural with iOS and Xcode. One example is to gather reusable functionality in a
shared library. It is not as easy-going in iOS as it is in .NET.

I have found several blog entries that describe how to accomplish this. One good
example is [http://www.clintharris.net/2009/iphone-app-shared-libraries/](http://www.clintharris.net/2009/iphone-app-shared-libraries/)
