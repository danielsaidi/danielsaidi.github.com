In my last entry, I wrote about problems with my MacBook (strangely though, this
computer is by far the best I've ever had...which says a LOT about PC:s :)

The last problem in the long list of problems was that my battery became swollen
and had to be replaced. Apple really sucks here, since batteries are not covered
by the guarantee. So, instead of buying a new Apple battery for $190, I found an
unofficial battery web site, where I could by the battery for almost half price.

After installing and calibrating the new battery, I was confused to see that the
MagSafe adapter started to toggle between orange (loading) and green (loaded). I
had the battery fully loaded, but the indicator seems to reach 100%, drops to 99%
and goes on like this. So, I received a replacement battery and installed it, to
find that the problem remains.

The problem can be either:

- The replacement battery (two in a row = unlikely)
- The battery together with my computer model
- My MagSafe adapter
- My computer's battery connection (due to the swollen battery)

To investigate further, I took my computer to a friend of mine and installed the
battery in her MacBook, where it worked like a charm...see below:

- Her computer, MagSafe and battery = OK
- Her computer and battery, but MY MagSafe = OK
- Her computer, but my battery and MagSafe = OK

So, this did not seem so promising...but when I re-installed the battery into MY
computer, using MY MagSafe...it suddenly worked! Baffled (yet happy), I returned
home, where everything continued to work for a while. After a couple of hours or
so, however, the MagSafe indicator started to blink once again! It still does so,
so I am once again stuck with a MacBook component that does not work.

If we boil this down to a summary, the battery seems OK, since it did work in my
friend's computer. However, so did the MagSafe, but......is it possible that the
MagSafe is damaged and only happened to be ok when I tried it my friend's place?

I will call another friend now, and ask him to come over with his MagSafe. If it
works, it seems like I have to go to where I bought my computer and get help.
