I have now created my first iOS app UI. It's a nice tab bar that toggles between
four different views. This $$$ are not far away now.

I now want to persist a string that I can enter in a text field, so that the app
remembers the string the next time I start the application. For the small amount
of data this involves, I don't want to go through the hassle of using a database.

[This great tutorial](http://icodeblog.com/2008/10/03/iphone-programming-tutorial-savingretrieving-data-using-nsuserdefaults) describes
how this is done with `NSUserDefaults`, which is ideal for saving a small amount
of data.
