I have now created my firs iOS app UI - a nice tab bar that toggles between four
different views. This $$$ are not far away now.

I now want to persist a string that I can enter in a text field, so that the app
remembers the string the next time I start the application. For this small piece
of data, I do not want to go through the hassle of using a database.

This great tutorial describes exactly how this is done:

`NSUserDefaults` is ideal for saving small amounts of data. Check it out.
