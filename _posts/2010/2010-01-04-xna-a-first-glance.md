I have started looking at XNA, which I've been longing to do for quite some time
now. After installing Visual C# Express 2008 and XNA 3.1 at home, my friend Jens
came over to guide me some of the basics.

After two minutes or so, we happily loaded a texture by pressing space. Although
I'm sure XNA has more to offer, I'm glad to be on my way to create a crappy game
that no one will ever download ;)

Jens, however, has created quite a few games for XNA on his profile - *kobingo*.
Make sure to check them out, especially the really nice *Painting Party* app!
