The time has finally come to throw Arial and Verdana and a bunch of other crappy
fonts into the trash bin (Helvetica can stay for a while), as Monotype, Linotype
and ITC (and others) have teamed up and developed a really cool service.

[webfonts.fonts.com](http://webfonts.fonts.com) lets you use over 7,500 fonts on
your sites. The result is not an image, but markable, search engine friendly and
editable text.

To get started with this, visit [webfonts.fonts.com](http://webfonts.fonts.com/)
and register as a user. You'll then be able to create projects, to which you can
add these custom fonts. After that, you can bind the fonts to your CSS elements,
classes and id:s and paste the generated JavaScript snippet to your site.

Web fonts is free up to a certain amount of page hits, but the free account will
not give you access to all the fonts. Still, 1.500 free fonts is a great service,
so make sure to try it out!
