This session was interesting and required a lot of attention, which made it hard
for me to sum it up properly. The abstract explains what the talk focused on:

> "Is there a sure-fire methodology that will make distributed teams work? Possibly.
Can a dogma save your deadline and make your wife and kids happy? Perhaps. Or is
it time to be pragmatic and realize that it all starts with people and ends with
people - with some coding in the middle?"

With distributed teams, every mistake is amplified tenfold, so once we decide to
adopt distributed teams, we must make sure that we have things figured out, or at
least be prepared to change depending on the situation.

One way to end up in a distributed team context is when we outsource parts of our
work. Why do we outsource? Often, to cut cost. But how much costs can we cut? 15%?
20%? Outsourcing to save 20% is madness. 20% is nothing, given the high risk that
comes with outsourcing. Do we outsource out of stupidity? Perhaps.

However, some work actually fits this model, like support. Other type of work is
more likely to face severe problems. In all distributed team setups, feedback is
crucial. Give feedback often, even to yourself. Check and value the feedback loop.

Bjorn had a very interesting passage about values versus rules. This can be hard
in a distributed context. Should we have rules that apply to every possible problem,
or should try to find some basic values that we all share, so that the team as a
whole know how to act and behave, out of the values we share?

This is hard, because when working in a distributed context, how do we know what
our company is all about? If you see bad comments about your company on Twitter,
how do you act? What kind of photos do you like on Instagram? In a distributed
context, value are extremely important. Having universal rules is impossible and
if you do not have clear values in place, people will make up values of their own.

You need everyone to know what you all are all about. As always, your people are
your greatest asset...and potentially your greatest problem.

Another nice passage was that about time differences. The time difference between
Sweden and GB is one hour, technically, but all overlaps make the time when your
people can actually meet a lot less. Different cultures will present a new set of
challenges, like vacations. While Swedes disappear for entire summers, Englishmen
distribute their days off over the year. This will cause problems if your people
canät get in touch with each other. Language structures, e.g. languages different
tense, can result in that you do not talk about the same thing, but think you do.

To understand each other, meet often. And talk talk talk.

Continuing on about being right and yet failing, face time and generation y, the
10 minute pattern, ideal team sizes etc. Bjorn left my brain filled to the brink
of burst. Want a brain filled to the brink of burst? [Watch the video](http://oredev.org/oredev2013/2013/videos.html)!
