Before I start writing about how perfect this session was, first some background
information.

The night before the talk, I went to bed at 2 am after a night out with my great
colleagues from eBay Sweden. To avoid having a day with heavy lids, I calculated
that going to bed at 2 am would give me 6 hours of deep sleep. More than enough
(I get by on 4). The perfect plan.

At 5 am, however, I was woken up by the world collapsing. Or so I thought. I was
violently pulled out of my sleep after a mere 3 hours. Looking out of the poorly
isolated window with my heart racing, I saw to two huge machines tearing up the
asphalt right outside my window. The sound was terrible. Then came the jackhammers.

It was a tired Daniel who walked in to Shay's talk the next day. As Shay prepared
the crowd with funny image after funny image after funny random stuff on the web,
I knew that I had chosen the right talk for my current state of vegetable mind.

By that, I don't mean that Shayâ€™s talk was trivial. In fact, it was brilliant.

In his talk, Shay built an application from (kinda) scratch, using NuGet packages
to fill out the blanks. It was nothing less than an excellent demonstration of the
power that comes to those who instead of writing what is already out there, first
take a trip by NuGet and fill the cart with already developed tools. I no time at
all, Shay created an app that could interpret six languages, export data to various
formats, format text, extract video from YouTube etc. etc.

I will not go through all the packages being used in the application, but I found
the Roslyn, Ruby, Python and some JavaScript code runners to be really cool. And
FluentDateTime. And the YouTube video extractor. And ObjectDumper. And Ensure.That.
And...well, [Check out the video here](http://oredev.org/oredev2013/2013/videos.html)
and see for yourself.

If you want a great NuGet demonstration, this is (probably) the one demonstration
to rule them all. Check out the video. To quote Shay: why not?
