In this post, we'll discuss how to Base64 encode and decode strings in Swift. We'll then create extensions that make this a lot easier and more readable.


## The basics

It's very easy to Base64 encode strings in Swift. You just have to convert it to `Data`, then encode that data with `base64EncodedString()`:

```swift
let string = "Let's encode this string"
let encoded = string.data(using: .utf8)?.base64EncodedString()
```

To decode a Base64 string, you just have to convert it to `Data`, then create a `String` from the decoded data:

```swift
guard let data = Data(base64Encoded: self) else { return nil }
return String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
```

Note that both encoding and decoding can fail, which means that the operations produce optional strings. 


## Extending String

Although the above operations are very easy and straightforward, I prefer to use more convenient extensions, to avoid having to write the same code over and over.

To encode strings, I just wrap the encoding logic in a `String` extension:

```swift
func base64Encoded() -> String? {
    data(using: .utf8)?.base64EncodedString()
}
```

I also do the same for the decoding logic:

```swift
func base64Decoded() -> String? {
    guard let data = Data(base64Encoded: self) else { return nil }
    return String(data: data, encoding: .utf8)
}
```

We can now encode and decode strings like this:

```swift
let string = "Let's encode this string"
let encoded = string.base64Encoded()
let decoded = encoded?.base64Decoded()
```

I think that this is a lot cleaner. Since the decode logic requires a `guard`, you also save one line each time and avoid control flow where you may not want it.


## Source code

I have added these extensions to my [SwiftKit]({{page.lib}}) library. You can find the source code [here]({{page.source}}) and the unit tests [here]({{page.tests}}).
