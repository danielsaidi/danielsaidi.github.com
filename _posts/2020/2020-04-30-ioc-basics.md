In this post, we'll look at the basics of Inversion of Control (IoC) and Dependency Injection and how to reduce coupling within your code base.


## The basics

Consider that you have an app that lets a user to log in and out. For the sake of simplicity, let's say that calling a global `login` function calls an external api to get the job done.

If your app calls `login` directly, you have a strong dependency to the function and api call. If you want to change the login behavior to e.g. add additional functionality, you have to change the function implementation. Also, testing the parts of your code base that depend on this function will be hard in a clean way.

What you can do then, is to create a class that performs the login operation, for instance a `LoginService` class. You can then replace all `login` calls with using this service. However, you *still* have a strong dependency to the same functionality. You just moved it somewhere else.

You can then remove the strong dependency to the login service class by creating a `protocol` that instead describes what a "LoginService" should be able to do (when you're in this mindset, you often start designing the protocols before creating the implementations) then let your app depend on the protocol instead of the concrete class.

Dependending on protocols instead of concrete types gives you *lot* of flexibility, where you can replace implementations without having to change any logic. You can also compose various implementations (e.g. using the **decorator pattern**) to enrichen the feature set of a component type without changing the functionality of each implementation.

To manage dependencies, you have various alternatives, where **dependency injection** is one. Injecting dependencies mean that you provide components with their dependencies instead of having your types defining what kind of implementations they want.

There are numerous tools that let you implement dependency injection, where [Dip]({{page.dip}}) and [Swinject]({{page.swinject}}) are two great ones. Give them a look and start breaking up your strong dependencies üëç


## Do not rely on your dependency manager

So, you have decided to use a dependency manager after reading the text above? Wow, that's great! I hope that it feels nice to reduce the hard dependencies in your code and manage them in a central manner. God knows I can't code in any other way. 

But with this way of handling dependencies, how much do you depend on your...dependency manager?

Since I aim to reduce coupling *everywhere*, I also always create an abstraction layer between my systems and how they resolve dependencies. I have added such tools to my [SwiftKit]({{page.lib}}) library, which contains a lot of additional functionality for Swift, like extensions, types, utilities etc.

The `IoC` model let's you register any dependency manager, as long as you make it implement a simple `IoCContainer` protocol. The library also contains commented out implementations for `Dip` and `Swinject`. The solution is abstract and allows for testing, mocking, composition and all those good things.

You can find the source code [here]({{page.source}}) and the unit tests [here]({{page.tests}}). There is also a demo app that demonstrates how you can register and resolve dependencies. Feel free to give it a try and let me know what you think.
