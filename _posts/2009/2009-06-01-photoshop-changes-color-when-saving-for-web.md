When designing web site artwork in Photoshop, I have experienced that images are
not as crisp and colorful when exported for the web.

Another problem is that the resulting image color differs from the corresponding
color in the raw image, although nothing is done to the color profile or balance.

When having these problems, [this excellent post](http://www.viget.com/inspire/the-mysterious-save-for-web-color-shift/)
helped me configure Photoshop to properly export images for the web. Now, colors
look identical when exporting for the web.

Hope it helps!
