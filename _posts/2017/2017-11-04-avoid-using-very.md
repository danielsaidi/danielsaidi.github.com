As a Swede, I'm often frustrated by my restricted English vocabulary. In lack of
a rich set of adjectives, I'm often forced into a bad habit of using a basic set
which I then emphasize by throwing in a "very" or "really". It is frustrating to
feel how your well-developed Swedish thought is ground into banality, as you try
to verbalize it in English. Must be tedious to listen to as well.

Going through my old Evernote notes, I found this nice golden oldie, which I had
completely forgotten about:

Sure, many words in the matrix above may sound a bit too British, but I'd rather
speak like an English lord-wannabe than like the sad verbal excuse of a man that
I am today.
