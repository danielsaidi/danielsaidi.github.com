As a Swede, I'm often frustrated by my English vocabulary. In lack of a rich set
of adjectives, I most often use a basic set and throw in a "very" or "really" to
emphasize them.

However, goign through my old Evernote notes, I found this nice golden oldie. It
made me jubilant, since it's such a neat set of brilliant replacements to "very"
and "really". Time to enrichen that lacking vocabulary of yours? Here you go:

Enjoy!
