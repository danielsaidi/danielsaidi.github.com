When I bought my iPad Pro, I had some naive idea about using it as a lightweight
coding environment, at least for blogging, coding JavaScript etc. However, Apple
saying that the iPad Pro is more computer than a computer really didn’t help, as
I found setting it up for coding was more or less a no-can-do.

However, today I decided to give [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com) a go.
Downloading it is straightforward, but as I tried to login to GitHub to clone my
repository, I was asked to give Working Copy full access to my SSH keys and more.
This seemed strange. I was rather expecting WC to simplify creating new keys and
add them to GitHub. I decided to skip this step for now and clone with HTTP.

After cloning the repo, I started giving blogging in Working Copy a try. In fact,
I am writing this very text as a test, to see if it works. Adding a new post was
super easy, so I copied the content from another MarkDown file and got started.

Working Copy has a nice, clean text editor. I immediately thought this was going
to be all I would need, but I quickly ran into some obvious deal breakers:

* The editor starts each new line with a capital letter, which forces me to type
two letters, then delete the first capital one. I haven’t found a setting that I
can use to disable this. It’s annoying and makes typing in MarkDown a hassle.

* The editor takes a long time to convert text to MarkDown. This causes new text
to have a larger font than the converted text, until the editor converts it.

However, bear in mind that Working Copy is a git client, not a text editor. That
I am at all able to write MarkDown texts as well as I can in Working Copy, is in
fact a bonus, rather than a let-down.

I will download a better text editor for the iPad and connect it to Working Copy.
Perhaps this will make typing more pleasant. I will write a blog post about this
once I get around to it.

When I finished typing, I could just switch over to status and commit my changes.
If you see this blog post on my web site, it means everything worked out well.
