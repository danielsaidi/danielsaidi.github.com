Blend away
==========

I’ve bought myself an empty life
just to feel alive
and tinted all my grayish days
with these gadget dreams

Time will hopefully just blend away my life
I hope I’m going to spend these days right
You claim I’ll like it,
but I doubt I’ll make it

All these mankind souvenirs
tell me it’s for real
I’m much too gone to speak of things,
it doesn’t mean a thing now

Hopefully I’ll blend away in time
I hope I’m going to spend these days right
You claim I’ll like it,
but I doubt I’ll make it
