Steps Behind
============

She always breathed air
that he had exhaled minutes before
Afraid to be standing in his way,
she rented flats too grey
for eyes to see that she is now
his living image, steps behind

Her trust of feelings
did run out in the sand,
'cause an incomplete heart torn apart
won't help her where she stands
She tries to merge the tears of now
with laughs of past
to help a fading hope stay sane

Now her face is never painted
with the tears of laugh
Her purple mornings bleed in grey -
keep wetting up the concrete ground
where nothing lives
A living image steps inside

Her trust of feelings
did run out in the sand,
'cause an incomplete heart torn apart
won't help her where she stands
She tries to merge the tears of now
with laughs of past
to help a fading hope stay sane

So stay sane
