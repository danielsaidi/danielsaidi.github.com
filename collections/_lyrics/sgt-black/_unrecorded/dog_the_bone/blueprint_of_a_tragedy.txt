Blueprint of a Tragedy
======================

She turned around,
walked away too late,
faded along the way, so long

It's a blueprint of a tragedy
Sign here: ___________ (easy earning)
Sell her blueprint of a tragedy
Tell her stories of a family in need
We won't loose sales by lying

He had enough,
tired life, low minded
Painted walls to fly
Now, we all ask why

It's a blueprint of a tragedy
Sign here: ___________ (it just take a second)
Show us pictures from a tragedy
Show us pictures of a man
who'll live for eternity
We won't loose sales by lying

It's their choice to live a life
through which stories are born

Public news, there's more,
cause we all need to know

Waiting for it,
you'll be paying for it
We'll feed it to you
