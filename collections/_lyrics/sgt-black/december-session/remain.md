Her ticket was the wind
But it never grabbed her
She waited for a bigger, faster change
The most glorious way out of here

But now, things never change
Not around here anyway
It's just more of the same, same, same
There is no way out of here

She tries so hard everyday
Not too remain the same

Her ticket was the wind
But it blew right by her
She's seen so many leave this place
In less glorious ways, anyway

She tries so hard everyday
Not to remain the same
Not to become the one who stayed
Must make a change someway

But still all things remain
The bad habits as well
It's such a shame, shame, shame
There's no decent way out of here

She tries so hard everyday
Not to remain the same
Not to become the one who stayed
Must make a change someday

What's left is fear for the unknown
And the things that may have been
She's torn by sickness to the bone
And like a stone she's sinking
How could she ever dream
How could she be so na√Øve?
She is sickened by her irony
But she cannot change a thing

The only thing is to remain
