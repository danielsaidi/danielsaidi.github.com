Damn
Now my shiver speaks
Of things unseen,
Such things that peel the skin off

Case: Never happened
Caged: I guess it did
It's time to peel all dreams off

Betrayed by my shiver
Betrayed by my shiver
Betrayed by my shiver

Hell upon me

I turn away
‘Cause I fear my shiver
And swear to never turn again

Case: Never had the chance
To do it like,
To do it while it happened

Damned by a shiver
Damn, but it's not my skin
It's something deep inside me

Betrayed - not my shiver
Betrayed - not my shiver
Betrayed - not my shiver

Hell inside me

I turn away
‘Cause I damn that shiver
And swear that I will turn again

Brought back by a quiver
Back to walls once seen
To what have been,
To something

It's not a question about truth
It's just a wish for something true

It’s not me
Not a shiver, it's just me
It's not wish to be like you
It's just a...

So I betray with a shiver
So I betray with a shiver
So I betray with a shiver

Hell around me

I turn again
And share that shiver
Now it’s time to turn away

So, I turn away,
‘Cause I've shared that shiver
Now there's no need to turn again
