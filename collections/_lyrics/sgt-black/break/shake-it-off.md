How long 'til this is over with
How long 'til all is said and done?
Never asked to be the one to take you down
I fear that something still lives inside
And keeps this wheel spinning 'til
We've both been crucified

No, I don't want to be a storm in your head
To be blamed for living
I don't want to be a fucking storm in your head
Won't let this thing get out of hand

The tears that fall for me
I've learned to despise
Fall to blame for things not done
I can't make this sacrifice

I shake it off of me
Won't you also do it, do it please?
I shake you off of me
Won't you forget about me, do it please?
I shake it off of me
Won't you also do it, do it please?
It's not my responsibility

Let's get this over with now

Life goes down
Years gone now
Life goes down
Years gone

I don't want to be here
All I am is just a storm in your head
Just blamed for living
I don't want to be a fucking storm in your head
Won't let this thing get out of hand

Shake it off, off, off

I shake it off of me
Won't you also do it, do it please?
I shake you off of me
Won't you forget about me, do it please?
I shake it off of me
Won't you also do it, do it please?
It's not my responsibility

Let's get this over with now
