I want to be there to tempt your eyes
I want to be there for you to idolize

Look at me
At this artificial life I live
Placed within
To fill with nothing

Turn, turn off, turn away
Believe, it’s real
So hard to feel like I feel

So look at me,
At this pointless life I live
This is shit
And still, you’re nailed to it

Don’t want to be a needle in your eyes
Don’t want to be there for you to moralize

Look at me,
At this reflection of the lives you live
Nothing real,
Nothing left to feel

I want to be there to tempt your eyes
I want to be there for you to idolize
But it’s over
It’s over now
Decision: over
It’s over now

Look at me
At this humiliating life I live
This is shit
and still you’re nailed to it

Turn, turn off, turn away
Believe, it’s me
So hard to be like I am

I want to be there to tempt your eyes
I want to be there for you to idolize
Don’t want to be a needle in your eyes
Don’t want to be there for you to moralize

But it’s over
It’s over now
Decision: over
It’s over now
