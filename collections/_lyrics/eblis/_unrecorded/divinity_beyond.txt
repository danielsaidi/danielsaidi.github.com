Divinity Beyond
===============

I stood there leaning over bloodshed eyes
The last look she was able to take of me
before I set her spirit free
A surgery of dying flesh -
trails of constantly killing the corpse
I sacrifice her life to see
beyond the woven lies

And her female blood tastes fine
It lets me travel beyond time
And in a breath of immense loss
What is going on?

I stood there leaning over rotten flesh
Mutilated in order to set my spirit free
Come take me
Further beyond the illusion,
beyond the chaos of lives never lived
Beyond this choking confusion
I will never accept this life

So I rise beyond the lies
as I travel beyond time
All clear of what to come
Divinity beyond

Divine

So rised beyond the lies,
I still travel beyond time
Never to return into imprisonment
of souls like me,
of souls like me
I have set my spirit free
