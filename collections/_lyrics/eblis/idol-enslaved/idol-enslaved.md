In awe withdrawn from gleaming dawn
Mind focused
Never more ignored by others

Blind eyes dream away
To a distant, mind-raped day
Where mankind crawl in blood
To sacrifice their breed to the dark one

We fear bewilderment
In these peace-striving times
Blind to the consequences
Of our filth-fearing lives

At the rebirth of sickened hearts
We'll tear your minds apart

And as an answer to your prayers
We'll make you hate once again

Embrace bewilderment
In these chaotic times
And face the consequences
Of your filth-fearing lives

Bleed the blood of the damned
Walk hand in hand through cursed lands
Flee your fate

This is hatred!
