title: Serenade of entrapment
---

Silence
Entrapped in eternal time
With no chance to find
The way to break free
Is this my destiny?

Darkness
The intensity of this senselessness
Qnsnares my mind in chaotic dreams
But this is not my destiny

Hold on - Cling on to sanity
Hold on - Follow my voice
Hold on - The enslavement will be broken
Hold on - Follow my voice

Hold on - Cling on to sanity
Hold on - Follow my voice
Hold on - The entrapment will be broken
Hold on - Follow my voice

Through pain released
