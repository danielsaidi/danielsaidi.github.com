It started with a kiss
upon the lips of he who smiled
and when his world went cold,
he moved too slowly to stop the sunset
We light the cosmic disco-lights

Our hunger grows intense
And when our hunger grows intense
you’ll see that there’s no defense
And as our hunger grows intense
you’ll ask why…

…if we can move the stars
and dance upon the sky
Then why won’t we save your souls
and make you move as one with the music?
Well, it’s all a matter of your attitude
You’ll have to stop this way
of being afraid of earthly matters
Let’s light the cosmic disco-lights

Our hunger grows intense
And when our hunger grows intense
you’ll see that there’s no defense
And as our hunger grows intense
you’ll see that…

…we won’t save the world,
cause we’re shining brighter now

Our hunger grows intense
And when our hunger grows intense
you’ll see that there’s no defense
It’s when our hunger grows intense
you’ll see why
