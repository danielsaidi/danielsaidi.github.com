No
I’ve told you no
So many times that I know
This won’t be easy
I’d like it easy

Say
What to say?
I used to play my games
To make it easy
To make it easy

To hate me
To blame me

But no
You're still hanging on
It’s almost like two ends of a cord
Connected through eternal days of boredom
Why won’t you let me leave you?

Stay, that’s all you say
Your eyes are facing away
And that ain’t easy
I need it easy

But no
You're still hanging on

Go
It’s time to go
But your lips are moving like: “No
Don’t do it please!
How may I please you?”
So manic it’s tragic
