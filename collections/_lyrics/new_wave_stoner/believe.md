I’ve bought myself an empty life
Just to feel alive
And tinted all my grayish days
With these gadget dreams

Time will hopefully just blend away my life
I hope I’m going to spend these days right

You claim I’ll like it
But I doubt I’ll make it at all

All these mankind souvenirs
Tell me it’s for real
I’m much too gone to speak
Of things that don't mean a thing now

Hopefully I’ll blend away in time
I hope I’m going to spend these days right

You claim I’ll like it,
But I doubt I’ll make it at all
