Sweet girls over there
Come over here
Sit down with us
Sing with us 
A song of love
You must be sent from above

I was a lonely kid
on the Baltic Sea
You came to me
Mesmerized before me
You set me free
And I started to believe

Sweet girls over there
Come over here
Sit down with us
Sing with us 
A song of love
You must be sent from above

You've been walking forth and back
Forth and back
You walked forth and back
Forth and back
You walked forth and back
You gave me a heart attack

Sweet girls over there
Come over here
Sit down with us
Sing with us 
A song of love
You must be sent from above
