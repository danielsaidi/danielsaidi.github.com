The days you spend by yourself
are there to paint
smiles on our faces
Life fades
Relive those memories
that only seems
like fading dreams
Try to fall asleep

Well, remember this
If you can't remember anything at all
Remember this
Cause you will surely regret
Your ignorant way
of leaving friends behind
Blind eyes bleed this time

You spend your days alone
Free to moan
Letting bottles roll
Life flows
And a dusty haze
slowly stains
smiles on our faces
Pictures of times to come once again

Remember this
If you can't remember anything at all
Remember this
Cause you will surely regret
your ignorant way
of leaving friends behind,
Blind eyes bleed this time
