Your blindfolded reality soon will cease
So shred out your blind eyes
And see the true face of the world
Your reality repulsively combined
With this chaotic insanity

We were the bended minds
Concealed to mankind
Minds will collapse
During this infection of reality

This is the time
When your guardian angels burn
And the forests open up
For the living earth

We were taken to utter not a word
Humiliated and forsaken
They knew it all
Fed our minds with fear
For the barrier to fall

Eternal time contorts
What has never been taken place
Live to accept
Accept to forget
Forget to live

They are the voices that leave no choices
Our darkest visions impersonated

We were taken to utter not a word
Tormented and forsaken
We saw it all
Involuntarily we razed the barrier

We've seen it before
We've known it ever since
We became old enough to understand
They have always been close
Sharing glimpses of the future
Twisting truth into the biggest of lies
A legend now brought to life
As we inject the visions they want us to see
But why?
Why did I have to be granted this gift?

It's all a lie

Creates of the mind
Bring forth the truth since long forgotten!
Schizophrenia is brought into another level

They are the voices that leave no choices
Our darkest visions impersonated

We were taken to utter not a word
Abused and forsaken
They knew it all
But who will protect them now,
When their reality falls
