Forged in fire by the hellspawns
Then kept in earth for several eons
Then carried further by the cold winds
To the riverdales in the north

Black waters of frustration
The result of a dying world’s despair
And as the elements came together
It’s body was grinded
By the waters of the damned

A talisman of evil mind
Enslaving souls
End of mankind

And so the black crystal of agony
Fulfills the foreseen prophecy
The keeper this crimson stone
Will possess the dark throne

Carried on along the battlefield
As the weapon of dark birth
Bringing life to ancient warriors
Rising from the blood-soaked earth

The night devours the sunlight
To the hymns of resignation
Human slaughter
Extensive desolation

Once foretold
Now fulfilled
Behold the blood that’s been spilled
Written down centuries ago

But the priests ignored the prophecy
There would be no extinction of humanity
The dark son of the elements
Would never appear
The world will see

Now they are adoring the path around the stronghold
Hung up in their own guts
Blind eyes search for the way to heaven

The shadows are drenching the world
From the stronghold they’re rising
Enslaving humans that stand in their way
The way to ultimate darkness
