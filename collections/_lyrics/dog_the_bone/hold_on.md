Painted angels of the night
Will you shine on through
Let lipstick lead your way through darkness?
And when it’s time to walk away
Will you flow on
Deny the fact you started to like him?

Hold on, believe
that day will conquer
Hold on, break free
This time you’ll make it

Lean back and swing your legs
The bed's too high
for painted toenails to reach down
It’s time to walk away
But the face just change
The bed is all you have to cling on to

Too long, these days 
will never fade out
So long, get laid
You’ll never make it

Stop whining, money’s rolling in
Stop whining, quit folding
Stop whining, you’re into this too deep
Stop whining

You stain your face
So tired of blowing like a hurricane
You stain your face
So tired

Hold on
Will you still believe
Will you rise above grieving?
Hold on
Will you break on through,
not let them touch you?

Stop whining, money’s rolling in
Stop whining, quit folding
Stop whining, you’re into this too deep
Stop whining

Hold on
Will you still believe
Will you rise above grieving?
Hold on
Will you break on through,
not let them touch you?
Too long,
these days that cling on
and never fades out

So long
