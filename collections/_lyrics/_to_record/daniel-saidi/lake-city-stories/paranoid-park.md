A little lie in the corner of your eyes
A little lie in the night
A little lie in the corner of your smile
Is a little lie to hide

Where did you do,
My pretty little sweetheart?
Did you do to paranoid park?
Did you take a ride on a night train?
Did you cut someone in half?

I guess that I cannot really blame you
'Cause I paid to paint my TV
With your crimes,
With teenage times,
With a never-ending shower scene

Where did you do,
My pretty little sweetheart?
Did you do to paranoid park?
Did you take a ride on a night train?
Did you cut someone in half?
