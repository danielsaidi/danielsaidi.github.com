I can't see you, but I can feel you
All around, like an ambient sound
Like the air you're there, transparent to the eye,
Still present enough to make your way inside

I really cant say when I noticed you first,
But when I realized that I satisfied
A thirst of some kind, it flattened me
To the extent that I let your love roam free

It's the way that you love me
In that distant kind of way
That makes you close to me
I just can't get away

Whenever I attempt to
Break myself free from you,
You materialize, opaque to the eye,
Tracing me 'til there's no place left to hide

It's the way that you love me
In that possessed kind of way
That makes you close to me
I just can't get away

Finally, it's clear to me that
You're eternal like the sun is eternal
Is that how I make you feel?
Is that why you won't let me be?

I can never love you 
The way that you love me
It's really hard to love 
When all you want to be is free

It's the way that you love me
In that final kind of way
That makes you close to me
I just can't get away
