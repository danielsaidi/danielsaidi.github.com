Your time is up
The seconds that passed made no change
Cause no one here would ever doubt to let you go
You’re not alone
But no one’s here to answer
No one here to scream "Hello"

Lighten up
You better believe in something new
Lighten up
You better believe it’s something...

...that you may grab
That you may grab
Without the constant fear
That you’ll have to let it go
You’re not alone, (you’re so alone)
But even your echo fails you
No reply to your “Hello?”

Lighten up
You better believe in something new
Lighten up
You better believe and pierce it through
Lighten up
You better believe it’s sometimes good to
Lighten up
