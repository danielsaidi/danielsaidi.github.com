A stroke of hand,
a bit too hard,
a bit too hard to please you
And spoken words,
a bit too raw,
a bit too raw to keep you calm

You start running away

You're waiting still
for raising fists to meet you
in rip of lips and bleeding skin
Bleeding skin wont ever heal

Still running away

You're waiting still for his
raising fists,
that raising fists will meet you
in rip of lips

You shield your mind
with twisted thoughts,
but twisted thoughts won't hide you
Can't cover fear with an attitude,
an attitude that suits you bad

So, run away

You're waiting still for his
raising fists,
that raising fists will meet you
in rip of lips

You burn, but won't cry, won't bleed

You learn to share once again,
but once again it rips your face
in rip of tears,
It's just fear,
but fear alone will keep you strong

You start to run away, again
