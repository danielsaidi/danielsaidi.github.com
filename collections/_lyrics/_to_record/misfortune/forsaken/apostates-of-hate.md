When angels bleed
When feathers fall in moaning
When divinity is stained by their selfish deeds
He commands (We will)
They stand ready (Follow you)
Tells them what to do
In order to prove their devotion

Infecting from within
Infecting their souls
Ancient manifestation of evil
Bring them into your world!

Bring us into your world!

The god of rage
Ancient king of Inferno
Contorts the creations of God
Into apostates of hate

A march through barriers of deeds
A march through ancient lands
An aiming to reach the dimension
Where the final battle’ll stand
Fallen angels with broken wings
And weapon in hands

God’s servants
Defenders of lies
God’s servants
It’s time to die

Paradise
The kingdom of lies
Vanishing in flames
Behold the apostates of hate!

Pale skin reflect the apocalypse
The reign of hatred begins

Infected from within
Many infected souls
An ancient manifestation of evil
Steps into our world

I step into this world
