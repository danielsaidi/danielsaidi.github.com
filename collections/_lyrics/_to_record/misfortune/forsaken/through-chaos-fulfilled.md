Kneeling in front of the idolized goddess
Who’s perverted influence enwraps the enclosed garden
A monument of twisted limbs
Reaches out to the well in which she hides within

She’s the mother of them all
A mindless beast of devastation
A boiling mass of flesh entrapped

She is arisen once again
The residues of many men

Bursting out in a fountain of blood
The world will face her essence

Through chaos she’s fulfilled

Ahead of her, her children raze the land
Prepare for the day of the flesh
Under her hands, cities turn to sand
Bring forth thy destruction!
Chaos the drenches the world for evermore
Children of the damned salute her
Embrace us mother!

She’s the mother of them all
A pile of meat and body-fluids
Bringer of death
She’s chaos in it’s purest form

She goes to rest once again
The residues of many men
