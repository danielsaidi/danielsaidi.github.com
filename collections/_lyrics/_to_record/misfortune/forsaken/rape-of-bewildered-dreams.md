Face the end of all your dreams!

Through illogical pattern of minds
I adapt to insanity to reach even deeper
Into this jigsaw of mankind’s secret believes

Mutilate piece by piece
I will rip, penetrate and rape your dreams

Dreams of oblivion will shield you not for long
I combine the rituals
You belong in this twisted, mental reality
Face the end of all your dreams

Aren’t tormenting memories enough?
I’ll stain your mind with the purest of sins
Pervert your fantasies
And nail your soul to eternal grief

I will rape your dreams!
Face the end of all your dreams!

Grief and despair will break the barrier
I combine the rituals
You belong in this abstract, mental reality
I’m the end of all your dreams

I will rape your dreams!
