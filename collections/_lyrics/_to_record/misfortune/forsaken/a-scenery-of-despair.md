A silent wind caresses my cheek
Like a fatherly hand stretched out
And the shadows flutter in fading light
They're alive
As hatred breeds in the twilight sky

A beautiful scenery of despair
A mystic act of the purest grief
Coming alive in the madness of night
I'm dazzled by secrets the darkness dwells

Once again I witness this play
Of souls crying out in pain
A fruitless search in the wildest of dreams
To wash away the bloodstains
They die, they die
Over and over again

Once immortal, brave men
Now wander the earth in confusion
In a quest for answer to their grief
It's all a part of the nocturnal theatre

A painful act of misery
In a mist of madness they hide
Winds of grief, carry them on
Through their darkest secrets
Screams of horror echo long
Throughout the tormenting darkness

A beautiful scenery of despair
A mystic act of the purest grief
Coming alive in the madness of night
I'm dazzled by secrets the darkness dwells
