Within I’m without
Cold loss is coming down
Itch one, ache three
Through all you covered me in

Hate me, and so join me
It’s a feeling deep inside
Not to be real
And I wish to burn it away
To burn it all away
So this feeling through my eyes
Will slowly leave me

Breath in, spit out
Those words you love to shout
Itch one, ache three
So useless, cease to breath

Blame me, if it makes it easy
It’s a feeling deep inside
That your anger is real
And I wish to burn it away
To burn it all away
So a feeling of total night
Will slowly leave me

Shame on me,
I don’t deserve to bleed,
But a feeling deep inside
Is slowly craving to come out
And I wish to burn it away
To burn it all away
It is time to kill the light
And count me in

Burn it away
