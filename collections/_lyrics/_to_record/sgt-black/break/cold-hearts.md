Thought that life was free for those who tried
But the price is getting higher by the minute
Still, we push our luck too far
Unaware that we may push it to the limit

Life won't start
In cold hearts

I made myself a promise not to cry
But the doubt inside was more than I could handle
What chance have we if life won't come our way
And love must be tricked out with living candles?

Light goes out, time runs out
Life won't start in cold hearts

Taught as kids that nothing’s free
Taught to become what others want us to be
And not to say what we want, when we want to
'Cause we’re always wrong
Have to find out for ourselves, from the start
Where to belong

Light goes out
Time runs out
Life won't start
In cold hearts

Teach our kids that nothing’s free
Tell them to become what we want them to be
And not to say what they want when they want to
'Cause they’re always wrong
Have to find out for themselves, from the start
Where to belong

Night comes down
Light goes out
Life won't start
In cold hearts
