I want to close my eyes
It's time
I'll be just fine in time
At ease
Please donâ€™t cry

Time seems endlessly
And I
Can't stand this empty life
Fade, fade, smile

Deny, why deny me
a dive into my dreams?
And why, why fear the dive
when the dive will let me dream?

It opens up my eyes

So, it's time to let go
You know it's low to grow
This empty shell due to fear
When I'm just lying here

Deny, why deny me
a dive into my dreams?
Dive, we all fade in time
The dive will let me dream
