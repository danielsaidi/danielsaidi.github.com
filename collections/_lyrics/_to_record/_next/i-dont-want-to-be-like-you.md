It's been a while
A thousand miles
And now our roads meet one final time
We've stumbled on through what's wrong
Let's try to make us bleed as one

Belong to me
You belong to me

The taste of time melts in my mind
We were always out of time
Two young kids
Taught to kill
With sharpened words to fit these streets

Belong to you
I belong to you

But I want to be like you

I learned to breathe under your feet
Learned to laugh in one, two, three
Rising up from what's wrong
Our eyes will bleed as one

Belong to me
You belong to me

The taste of time melts in my mind
We were always out of time
Two young kids
Taught to kill
With sharpened words to fit these streets

Belong to you
I belong to you

But I want to be like you
