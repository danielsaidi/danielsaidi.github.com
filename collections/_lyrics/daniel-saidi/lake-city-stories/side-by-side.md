We spoke of departure long ago
Before our sharp eyes knew
What we in time have come to know,
That our fortune comes to few

In my eyes was your reflection
And in your eyes was mine,
Not meant to dim as long as we're alive 

The insight took us by surprise,
That we share a destiny
We failed to end it once,
Yet we tried it twice,
But it wasn't meant to be

In your eyes is my reflection
And in my eyes is yours,
In time they'll dim,
But even then we'll know

This is how we live,
This is how we'll die
Caught in this kiss,
Still side by side
And when it's time to go,
We'll be just fine,
'Cause we will always go
Side by side
