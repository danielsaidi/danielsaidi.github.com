title: Hard-to-write-song
---

I went into the ocean,
unaware of the rip
I went in without caution,
straight into its grip

How I realized just then,
that I wasn't that strong
How my legs fought for a way back
This is a hard-to-write song

An ocean pushing and pulling,
lifting up, pressing down
Arms shielding the precious,
hands protecting the crown

How I realized down there,
that I wouldn't last for that long
How my arms fought for a way back
This is a hard-to-write song

Writing on, on, on
I've been writing on this for so long
Writing on, on, on
But I'm never, ever done

I climbed up from the ocean,
fought the slippery wall
It's rocks shielding, yet threatening
to give in and let me fall

How I realized up there,
that everything still could go wrong
How my body fought for to hang on
This is a hard-to-write song

How I realize just now,
that there was were I belonged
Where I could gather some precious material
to this hard-to-write song

Writing on, on, on
I've been writing this for so very, very long
Writing on, on, on
Nine years not, but it's not still not done

Writing on, on, on
I've been writing on this song for so very long
Writing on, on, on
Let's just say that it is done
