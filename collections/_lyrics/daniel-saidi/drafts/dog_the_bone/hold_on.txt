Hold on
=======

Painted angels of the night,
will you shine on through,
let lipstick lead your way through darkness?
And when it’s time to walk away,
will you flow on,
deny the fact you started to like him?

Hold on, believe that day will conquer
Hold on, break free
This time you’ll make it

Lean back and swing your legs
The bed to high
for painted toenails to reach down
It’s time to walk away
But the face just change,
the bed is all you have to cling on to

Too long, these days will never fade out
So long, get laid
You’ll never make it

Stop whining, money’s rolling in
Stop whining, quit folding
Stop whining, you’re into this too deep
Stop whining

You stain your face,
so tired of blowing like a hurricane
You stain your face,
so tired

Hold on, will you still believe
and rise above grieving?
Hold on, will you break on through,
not let them touch you?

Stop whining, money’s rolling in
Stop whining, quit folding
Stop whining, you’re into this too deep
Stop whining

Hold on, will you still believe
and rise above grieving?
Hold on, will you break on through,
not let them touch you?
Too long, these days that cling on
and never fades out
So long
