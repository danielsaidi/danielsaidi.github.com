Helios
======

You wanna be a page,
you wanna be a frame,
but you're the laky one forever
You never seem to dry,
you never seem to stick
You're the faded one forever

Holy light...so beautiful
Hold the light...don't let it die

You wanna be a star
You wanna have it all  
Come on, come on
You wanna be mister Helios
You wanna be mister Ra
Come on, come on

With every breath that you have,
every damn breath you'll ever have
you'll make sure to shine and burn forever
You're running around 'round 'round 'round 'round
but nothing's good enough
Now, you're the burned out one forever

Holy light...so beautiful
Hold the light...don't let it die

You'll never be a star
You'll never have it all  
Come on, come on
You'll never be mister Helios
You'll never be mister Ra
Come on, come on
