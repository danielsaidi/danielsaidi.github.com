This is a short note to self about how to use `git` instead of `grep` to recursively find all occurrences of a certain text in all files within a root folder.

I have always used `grep` to do this, but always have to lookup the syntax and it's not as quick and intuitive as I'd like it to be.

However, `git grep` is a lot faster and much easier to use than `grep`. If you use `git grep` instead of `grep`, you just have to type:

```
git grep 'the string to search for'
```

or to narrow it down to a certain file type:

```
git grep 'the string to search for' *.txt
```

This is a lot cleaner and MUCH faster than `grep`.
