I'm very excited about the new Ubuntu Mobile platform, despite not being a Linux
or Ubuntu guy.

As Ubuntu was launched for mobile devices a short while back, a new mobile force
was born, according to David Planella. Unlike other mobile operative systems, no
names said, Ubuntu Mobile is designed to run on less powerful devices, while still
focusing on providing a fast and responsive user experience. It comes packed with
core apps and can be extended with third party developer apps. 

Sorry if this sounds like a sales pitch, I'm merely passing along what David said.

Something I find very promising with Ubuntu Mobile, is that the Ubuntu SDK comes
with full native and HTML 5 support. This is a path I think other mobile operating
systems should have adapted as well, instead of leaving us with a flora of native
platforms to master, besides the responsive mobile web experience we also have to
support when our systems are experienced through a web browser.

It's rather interesting that the first iPhone (launched before the App Store even
existed) was presented to developers with a big, dramatic "no SDK needed" callout.
The iPhone came with the world's greatest mobile web browser, perfectly capable
of running HTML5 apps. Why would anyone need or want anything else?

Then, Apple realized they could make money on app revenue...and here we are.

So, what about the user experience? Ubuntu Mobile's main design themes include
content focus, fast and natural interactions and sophisticated style. And I have
to say...it looks very slick. It uses Unity and screen features like edge swipes
to interact with the main areas of the phone. Right edge swipes move to the next
app, left edge swipes show the launcher etc. It looks really neat, although when
I tried it out, I noticed that it needs some more work on the responsiveness and
smoothness, especially when scrolling.

But, then again, so does Android.

David went into detail on how you interact with Ubuntu and core platform features
like notifications, a cool looking HUD, scopes etc. He also talked about how to
build apps, which SDKs to use and how developers can benefit from Ubuntu Mobile.
A really thorough and very interesting talk.

I am really impressed, so do [check out the video](http://oredev.org/oredev2013/2013/videos.html)
and tell me what you think. Could this be a glimpse of the future?
