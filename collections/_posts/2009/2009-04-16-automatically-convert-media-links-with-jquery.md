I am currently developing a PHP-based framework called Wigbi, which can be used
to quickly generate sites with a database, data objects that are auto-generated
in JavaScript, using PHP data classes. It also comes with a simple cms that lets
you add pages and populate them with text, images, links and any data object you
like. It's actually quite amazing.

As I now used Wigbi to create a personal web site, I downloaded the jQuery Flash
and Media plugins and was blown away! I use it to automatically convert "a" tags
that refer to MP3 files or YouTube clips to a music/video player! I also use the
media plugin to automatically convert any "a" tag that uses the "media" class to
the proper media player.

Check out the plugins for yourself - they are quite amazing:
