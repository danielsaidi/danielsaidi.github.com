Earlier this summer, the NDepend team released v4. I have been meaning to try it
out for some time, but life (summer, sun, vacation...hey, we Swedes live in snow,
cold and darkness for like 3/4 of the year) and some projects got in the way.

NDepend 4 seems really cool, though, with new LINQ features that I can't wait to
try. Until I do, you can read all about it [here](http://weblogs.asp.net/ricardoperes/archive/2012/06/13/ndepend-4-first-steps.aspx).
