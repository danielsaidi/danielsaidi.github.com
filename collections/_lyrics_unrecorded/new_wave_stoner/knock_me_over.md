I need no time to think
It’s pretty clear the way you feel
I guess that “we” is gone
and we’ll continue one and one

Won’t be the one to speak,
won’t let you lower me
I’m much too proud to play these games
You won’t knock me over

This trampled skin you see
won’t play the part
of a doormat under dirty feet
No feelings, why feelings
when it’s much easier to feel like this?

Won’t be the one to break,
won’t be the one to make things worse
I’ll try to stay away,
so don’t knock me over

I never seem to make
even the smallest change
My walls grow old and grey,
so come knock me over
Please knock me over
