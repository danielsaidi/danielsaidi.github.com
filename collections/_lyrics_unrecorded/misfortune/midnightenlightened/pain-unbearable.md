Shadowland on the other side
By our nocturnal rites he arises
Inside a temple of flesh he's been waiting
Now released before our eyes
Beams of light sealed him in
For his immense sins

Through the night our master comes
Shadows are hailing his freedom

He cuts the ears of the blind men
So that they can feel but his touch
Pain unbearable
Growing stronger
But not enough

He walks the path of the darkened sense
Through the night we march on
Follow the unleashed manifestation
Bringing on pain unbearable strong

Beams of darkness burst free from the shadowland
Night will last for eternity

He punctures the eyes of the deaf men
So that they can feel but his touch
Pain unbearable
Growing stronger
But not enough

Pain
The fine art of demise
Pain
Unbearable it shines
