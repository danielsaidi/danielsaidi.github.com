Is this a time to live
Or just a time to stay alive
Would you say?
You're scaling up the walls
Trying to reach a higher ground
Don't look down

And people are climbing all around
In an attempt to reach the sun
But too hot, hot
Falling all around
I'm digging deep for a better ground

Beneath the earth and soil
Is where I'll build a home
Won't you stay?
You've scaled for all these years
But you're still here by my side
Won't you stay with me?
Won't you stay with me?
Won't you stay with me?
Won't you stay a little while?

And people are falling all around
In an attempt to reach the sun
It's too hot, hot
Drying all around
I'm digging deep for a better ground

How can anyone stay sane
When there's no one left to save?
