She turned around
Walked away
Too late
Faded along the way
So long

It's a blueprint of a tragedy
Sign here: ___________ (easy earning)
Sell her blueprint of a tragedy
Tell her stories of a family in need
We won't loose sales by lying

He had enough
Tired life
Low minded
Painted walls to fly
Now, we all ask why

It's a blueprint of a tragedy
Sign here: ___________ (it just take a second)
Show us pictures from a tragedy
Show us pictures of a man
who'll live for eternity
We won't loose sales by lying

It's their choice to live a life
through which stories are born
Public news, you want some more?
We all need to know
Public news, there's more
We all need to know

Waiting for it
You're paying for it
We'll feed it to you
