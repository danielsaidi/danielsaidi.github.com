Empty walls
The colors fade
Empty hearts
The pounding as well
Tell me why it feels this way

Take me away
Back to our early days

When it was worth so much to be the only one
Now I can't stand to be the only one
Please come, come to me now
Show me of the meaning of being the one

Hollow words 
The final proof
Hollow hurts
Both me and you
Tell me why we live this through

And what to do

I should take you away
Back to our early days

When it was worth so much to be the only one
Seems you can't stand to be the only one
Please come, come to me now
Show me of the meaning of being the one

Strike me down

It feels like something is wrong
It feels like we don't belong here
It feels like something is gone
It feels like, feels like a grave

Is it too late
To return to our early days?

When it was worth so much to be the only one
Why is it so hard to be the only one?
Please come, come to me now
Show me of the meaning of being the one

It feels like we're both alone
It feels like no one deserves this
It feels like we're both gone
It feels like, feels like a grave

It feels like the light's gone out
It feels like there's no way out

It feels like something is wrong
It feels like no one deserves this
It feels like something is gone
It feels like, feels like a grave
