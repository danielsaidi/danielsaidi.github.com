I have found out what I want
And it's not to live intense and die alone

I want to hold you close, not hide away
But it's hard to see you laughing
And dancing away

I keep that laugh inside,
dreaming about making you smile
But it's hard to dream without longing

Waited too long, waited too long
When I waited for you to come home
I waited too long

And now I'm sitting here alone
Staring at these walls
Like I try to stare the bricks to pieces
I used to know, now I hope that I'm

Stronger than this,
Stronger than being broken down like this
Stronger than this

I waited to long
I waited too long and now you're gone
I waited for you to come home
