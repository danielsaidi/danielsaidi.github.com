Seconds of sliding
Blank expressions meet me in the rain
Sliding once again
Life is loosing grip

Your friendly words 
fail to silence the despair
That slowly puts 
dead flowers in my hair

I'm going down

Sick of denying
Faces cannot hide the falling rain
Denying what I am
Life begins to slip

I guess I fear
that someone’s there 
to take my place
As leaves and fallen flowers 
hide my face

I'm going down

I'm just wasting time
So forgettable

Leaping, flying
Gravity neglects the falling rain
Trying to find my way
Life has lost its grip

I’d like to break the silence
Shortly if I may
Cause it’s time to put 
some flowers on my grave

I've gone down now

I'm just wasted time
So forgettable

There is no more time
So forget about me please
There is no more time
