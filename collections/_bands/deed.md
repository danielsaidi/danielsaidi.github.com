dEEd was founded in 2007 and was inspired by bands like QotSA. We recorded two of the many songs we wrote, but until I get them up here, you can watch a short live clip [here]({{youtube-me}}).

I left dEEd in 2008, but they kept on playing with a new, great vocalist - Emma Fredriksson. They released an EP called [Starfucker]({{starfucker}}) in 2010 and played a [bunch of shows]({{youtube}}).
