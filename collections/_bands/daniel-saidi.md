I have always loved music and written songs since I was a kid. I started my first band at 15 and recorded a bunch of demos and [an EP]({{page.midnightenlightened}}) at 18.

I have played everything from pop to rock and metal, done vocals in all bands and played guitars in some. I played in bands until 2008, when I became a dad. I then decided to only write music and play for fun, whenever I had time. The music I play on my own is guitar-based and pretty basic.
