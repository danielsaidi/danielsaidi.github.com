Anomaly Software is an Australian tech-company that hired me for keyboard-related work and sponsored my [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) open source project.

Thanks to Anomaly Software, [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) has improved support for autocomplete. These features are available for both UIKit and SwiftUI.

Big thanks to Anomaly Software for sponsporing [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}})!
