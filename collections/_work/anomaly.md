Anomaly Software is an Australian technology company that hired me as a freelance developer for some keyboard related work. They sponsored the [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) open source project to add missing features. 

Thanks to Anomaly Software, [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) got improved support for autocomplete. These features are available for both the UIKit and SwiftUI parts of the library.

Big thanks to Anomaly Software for sponsporing [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}})!
