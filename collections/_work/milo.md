Milo Creative a UK tech-company that hired me for keyboard-related work and sponsored my [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) open source project to add missing features that they needed in one of their projects.

Thanks to Milo Creative, [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) has improved support for input sets, keyboard layouts and multiple locales. These features are available for both UIKit and SwiftUI.

Big thanks to Milo Creative for sponsporing [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}})!
