Milo Creative is a mobile product company that hired me as a freelance developer for some keyboard related work. They sponsored the [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) open source project to add missing features. 

Thanks to Milo Creative, [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}}) now has improved support for input sets, keyboard layouts and multiple locales. These features are available for both the UIKit and SwiftUI parts of the library.

Big thanks to Milo Creative for sponsporing [KeyboardKit]({{page.keyboardKit}})!
