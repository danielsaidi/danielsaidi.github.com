  I gave this talk to a group of college board representatives from China. I talked about how hobby projects can bring happiness, friendship and creativity and about how I have always been driven by the urge to create things together with others, be it music, magazines or code. I then talk about some collaborative projects, where I and my entire family collaborated with family members in San Francisco that we had never met before, to create a couple of iOS apps for children, and how we then went on to found Appamini and build two iOS games together.
