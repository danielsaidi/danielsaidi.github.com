        Here is a list of all the apps that I've built for iOS and Android. I will put together a page for each project, but until then the links just go to the App Store or the company page.

        I do freelance work, so don't hesitate to contact me if you want to build an app or need help with one that you have developed or are developing. I can help you with architecture, automation, testing, processes, technical advice, plain programming etc.
