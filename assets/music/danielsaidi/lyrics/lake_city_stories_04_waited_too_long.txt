Waited Too Long
===============

I have found out what I want
and it's not to live intense
and die alone

I want to hold you close, not hide away,
But it's hard to see you laughing
and dancing away

I keep that laugh inside,
dreaming about making you smile,
but it's hard to dream without longing

I think that I
waited too long,
when I waited for you to come home
I waited too long

And now I'm sitting here alone
staring at these walls,
like I try to stare the bricks to pieces

I used to know, now I hope that I'm
stronger than this,
stronger than being broken down like this
Stronger than this

I waited to long
I waited too long and now you're gone
I waited for you to come home
