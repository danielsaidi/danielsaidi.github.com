All there is
============

If you answered the walls,
would they bend?
To lean forward is to loose yourself
Show infinity reverence,
take a dive into the white

My sermon fades right through you
Must find her words to move you
If I could see then would you
show all there is
Now would you?
Why should you?

Make the rumble erupt,
make my blazing mouth shut up
To lean forward is to get revenge
Show infinity reverence,
take a dive into the white

My sermon fades right through you
Must find her words to move you
If I could see then would you
show all there is
Now would you?
Why should you?

My empty prayers bleed through you
Canâ€™t find the words she cut through you
Just let me deep into you
Show all there is
