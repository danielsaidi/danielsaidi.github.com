Blind Eyes Bleed
================

The days you spend by yourself
are there to paint
smiles on our faces
Life fades
Relive those memories
that only seems
like fading dreams
Try to fall asleep, well

Remember this,
if you can't remember anything at all
Remember this,
cause you will surely regret
your ignorant way
of leaving friends behind,
Blind eyes bleed this time

You spend your days alone -
free to moan,
letting bottles roll
And a dusty haze
slowly stains
smiles on our faces
Pictures of times to come once again

Remember this,
if you can't remember anything at all
Remember this,
cause you will surely regret
your ignorant way
of leaving friends behind,
Blind eyes bleed this time
