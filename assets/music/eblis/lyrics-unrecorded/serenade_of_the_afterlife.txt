Serenade of the Afterlife
=========================

You’re absorbed by silence,
now step through the barrier
I bid for your trust in me
on our journey towards the darkness

And do remember that the night contains
raging armies of souls led astray
But I will lead your way
Believe me, they won’t get to you

As we’re one with silence,
we step through the barrier
Drifting further into the afterlife
 Once flesh,
your spiritual freshness tempts them
But I will lead you further
Believe me, they won’t get to you

"I feel that you are divine,
but what is that glow in your eyes?"

I am just nocturnal,
through eternal night I wander
I bid for your trust in me
on our journey towards the darkness

The souls are closer now,
grasping for your soul to fetch
But I will keep you safe
Believe me, they won’t get to you

"I take your hand, travel on,
but now your divine aura is gone
As you’re dragging me on through this night
Draining my hope, stealing my light"
