Lighten Up
==========

Your time is up,
the seconds that passed made no change
cause no one here
would ever doubt to let you go
You’re not alone,
but no one’s here to answer,
no one here to scream

“Hello, lighten up,
you better believe in something new”
Lighten up,
you better believe it’s something…

…that you may grab,
that you may grab
without the constant fear
that you’ll have to let it go
You’re not alone, (you’re so alone)
but even your echo fails you;
no reply to your “hello?”

But lighten up
you better believe in something new
Lighten up,
you better believe and pierce it through
Lighten up,
you better believe it’s sometimes good to
Lighten up
