Down
====

Stained red on grey,
met my eyes
on their way down
Nails carving stone,
but no way up - too far down

All different now,
will make this mine,
must tear this down 
So I’ll stain pain on your strength
Walls will crumble and fall down

Don’t want to be
Don’t want to be an open road
for you to travel on
Don’t want to feel
don’t want to lie hidden in the dark
I deserve more

So many smiles to hate/adore,
to bring me down
Successful lives,
still glossy facades
will crumble and fall down

Don’t want to be…

Stained red on grey,
met my eyes
on their way down
Now I stain pain on your strength
Walls will crumble and fall down

Don’t want to be…

No, I won’t be,
I won’t be a nobody
when I can rule this world
And I won’t kneel,
won’t cease to exist among you all
I deserve more

Denied to breathe your air,
so I’ll suck it out of you
Looked down on all my life,
now I’ll stomp down on you
I never felt as one
Now, I’m the only one who stands
As we go down
