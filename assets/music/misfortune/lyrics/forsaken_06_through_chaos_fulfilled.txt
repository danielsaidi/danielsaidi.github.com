Through Chaos Fulfilled
=======================

Kneeling in front of the idolized goddess
who’s perverted influence
enwraps the enclosed garden
A monument of twisted limbs
reaches out to the well
in which she hides within

She’s the mother of them all,
a mindless beast of devastation,
a boiling mass of flesh entrapped

She is arisen once again -
the residues of many men

Bursting out in a fountain of blood,
the world will face her essence
Through chaos she’s fulfilled

Ahead of her, her children raze the land
Prepare for the day of the flesh
Under her hands, cities turn to sand
Bring forth thy destruction!
Chaos of the drenches the world for evermore
Children of the damned salute her
Embrace us mother!

She’s the mother of them all,
a pile of meat and body-fluids
Bringer of death -
she’s chaos in it’s purest form

She goes to rest once again -
the residues of many men
