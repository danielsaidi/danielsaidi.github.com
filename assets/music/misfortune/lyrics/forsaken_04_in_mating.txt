In Mating
=========

Her throat ensnared
by words once uttered in despair
She welcomed the beast,
once her lover, the greatest of all
Now she's bound to eternally suffer
Only her eyes reveal her entrapment

Her soul is raging,
can't hold back her thoughts
Deep inside she's putrefied
The child within her is born,
loose on the hunt,
unleashed from her cunt
For each day her soul fades 
in the last setting sun rays

She's the breeder of no man's child
Through the mating act
she became one with the unholy one

She raises her hand in a gesture of pain,
like a welcome sign for the evil one
Empty eyes stare into nothingness
She needs him inside,
just one more time

Lies are fulfilling her life
This is the end of the line
One more time he is filling her
A slave to the pleasures of flesh,
she's become his own
And each time she hates it so,
as she feel it grow

Open up she lies, like a sacrifice
A filthy ceremony of flesh
in the name of sin
Limbs like fire inside -
fatal to her pride
For the second time she is left
to her emptiness -
a child of fire

Once more the breeder of no man's child
In the perverted act
she became one with the unholy one

She raises her hand in a gesture of pain,
like a welcome sign for the evil one
Once again
