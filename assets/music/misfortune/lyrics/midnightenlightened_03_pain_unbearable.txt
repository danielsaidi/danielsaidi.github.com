Pain Unbearable
===============

Shadowland on the other side -
by our nocturnal rites he arises
Inside a temple of flesh he's been waiting,
now released before our eyes
Beams of light sealed him in
for his immense sins

Through the night our master comes,
shadows are hailing his freedom

He cuts the ears of the blind men,
so that they can feel but his touch
Pain unbearable, growing stronger,
but not enough

He walks the path of the darkened sense,
through the night we march on,
follow the unleashed manifestation,
bringing on pain unbearable strong
Beams of darkness burst free from the shadowland
Night will last for eternity

He punctures the eyes of the deaf men,
so that they can feel but his touch
Pain unbearable, growing stronger,
but not enough

Pain - the fine art of demise
Pain - unbearable it shines
