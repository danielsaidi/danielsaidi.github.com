title: "Improving Accessibility in a Popular Audio Book Service"
date: 2020-02-11
location: Nipi - Nordic Conference on Inclusive Publishing

abstract: |
  
  Most software companies want their products and services to be as accessible
  as possible to as many as possible. However, while many developer tools have
  good accessibility support, many non-technical challenges still stand in the
  way of creating accessible products. A lack of area expertise, resources and
  routines can make even the best of intentions fail.<br/>
 
  In this talk, I discuss how BookBeat worked together with MTM to improve the
  internal accessibility focus, as well as remaining challenges and some ideas
  for the future.
