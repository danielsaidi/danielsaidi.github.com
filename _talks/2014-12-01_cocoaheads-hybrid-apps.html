  In this talk, I describe how Steve Job's initial vision of 3rd party iOS apps
  went from mobile web browser experiences to the native apps we have today. I
  then go through a real-world case study of how a Swedish high-profile company
  replaced their native apps with custom-made hybrid apps that wrapped their new
  responsive web site.
