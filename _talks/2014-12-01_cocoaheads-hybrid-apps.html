  In this talk, I describe how Apple's initial vision of 3rd party iOS apps
  went from mobile web browser experiences to the native apps we have today.
  I then go through a case study of how a Swedish high-profile company did
  replace their native apps with custom-made, hybrid apps that wrapped their 
  new responsive web site.
