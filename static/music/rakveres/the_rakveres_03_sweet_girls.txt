Sweet Girls
===========

Sweet girls over there,
come over here
and sit down with us
Sing with us a song of love
You must be sent from above

I was a lonely kid
on the Baltic Sea
you came to me,
mesmerized before me
You set me free
and I started to believe

Sweet girls over there,
come over here
and sit down with us
Sing with us a song of love
You must be sent from above

You've been walking
forth and back,
forth and back,
You walked forth and back,
forth and back
You walked forth and back
and you gave me a heart attack

Sweet girls over there,
come over here
and sit down with us
Sing with us a song of love
You must be sent from above
