Paranoid Park
=============

A little lie in the corner of your eyes
A little lie in the night
A little lie in the corner of your smile
is a little lie to hide

Where did you do,
my pretty little sweetheart?
Did you do to paranoid park?
Did you take a ride on a night train?
Did you cut someone in half?

I guess that I cannot really blame you
'cause I paid to paint my TV
with your crimes,
with teenage times,
with a never-ending shower scene
