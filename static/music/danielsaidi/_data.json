		"After playing in various bands non-stop since 1995, I decided to ditch it all in 2008, when my first daughter was born. I think that the little spare time I now have is best shared with friends, instead of arguing over petty things in the rehersal local.",
		"I therefore decided to drop all my bands, and now only play for the fun of it and record songs when I have the time (which is not that often). It's not ambitious, the end result quality is terrible when compared to when we had time to invest in good recordings, but it is great fun whenever it happens."
