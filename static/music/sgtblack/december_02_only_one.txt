Only One
========

Empty walls -
the colors fade Empty hearts -
the pounding as well Tell me why
it feels this way  Take me away,
back to our early days 
when it was worth so much to be the only one Now, I can't stand to be the only one Please come, come to me now Show me of the meaning of being the one  Hollow words -
the final proof Hollow hurts both me and you Tell me why
we live this through and what to do  I should take you away, back to our early days 
when it was worth so much to be the only one Seems you cannot stand to be the only one Please come, come to me now Show me of the meaning of being the one  Strike me down  It feels like something is wrong It feels like we don't belong here It feels like something is gone It feels like, feels like a grave  Is it too late, to return to our early days?  when it was worth so much to be the only one Why is it so hard
to be the only one? Please come, come to me now Show me of the meaning of being the one  It feels like we're both alone It feels like no one deserves this It feels like we're both gone It feels like, feels like a grave  It feels like the light's gone out It feels like there's no way out  It feels like something is wrong It feels like no one deserves this It feels like something is gone It feels like, feels like a grave
