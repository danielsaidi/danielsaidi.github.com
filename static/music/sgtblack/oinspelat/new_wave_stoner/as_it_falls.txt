As it Falls
===========

He used to be out of control,
like a mad horse
He tried to stop the constant itch
at places that he couldn’t reach
And even though it’s said
that alone is strong,
he did need someone…
 
…to help him through these empty halls
where naked, crumbled walls
won’t keep his thoughts from himself
He is said to be a victim of society,
well so are we
We released his fury
into the streets

He swore that he would stand
by the line as it falls
and we will cut the line as it falls
