Changing
========

Where does this mind end?
Feels like I've searched forever
Suddenly, it all felt too real,
couldn't take it
Then: running for the king on stolen horses
Now: dragged out from within

Felt so unsure of myself
I couldn't cope being someone else
So, now I'm changing
more than just changing my name
And as my mind is giving in,
it gets easier to change who I am
At last my body's caving in
over my head

I guess this won't end,
guess I'll search forever
Maybe me, not an easy thing, couldn't tell
Then: born to be the king of stolen moments
Now: stealing everything…

…so that I can learn more about myself
I couldn't cope being someone strange to me
So, now I'm changing
I guess I'm changing myself
Once more my mind's giving in
How many times must I change?
Once more my body's caving in over my head

Why can't I remain?
I couldn't continue like that,
can not go on like this,
I just wish for peace,
so I can cease this breathing

So, changing
I guess I'm changing again
Once more my mind's giving in
How many times must I change
before I'm satisfied with this
Once more my body's caving in over my head

I guess I'm loosing myself
