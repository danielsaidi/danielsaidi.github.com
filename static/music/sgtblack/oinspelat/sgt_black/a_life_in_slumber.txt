A Life in Slumber
=================

Hiding away in the last rays,
she’s just another shadow now
Managed to fail her once again
She won’t be broken, though

You won’t pull her black soul
into where light is cold

But if you want to reach inside her,
that is fine
Still, even if you try to heal her,
you will find
that you’ll just fill her black hole
with what used to grow

Christina is crying in her sleep,
trying to create an emotion out of this
Still, silence like a bullet through her brain
as she’s waking up to a life in slumber
Who knows what to make of this?

Who knows where this circle ends?

Well, you managed to break her once again,
she’s just a faceless victim now
Now hiding away, it lets her soul fade,
she won’t be lost this time, though

You won’t pull her black soul
into where nothing grows

But if you want to reach inside her,
one more time
and even try to face her demons,
you will find
that you’ll just fill her black hole
with what was once whole

Christina is crying in her sleep,
trying to find a way handle this
Still, silence like a bullet through her brain
as she’s waking up to a life in slumber
Who knows what to make of this?
Who knows where this circle ends?
