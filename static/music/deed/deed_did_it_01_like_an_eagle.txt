Like An Eagle
=============

It's the way you move
in your earthbound ways
The way you move
betrays your race

Would you have settled for the sea?
Would you, would you?
Then settle, decline, retreat
While I...

While I fly,
while I soar like an eagle in the sky
I wanna fly
I wanna soar like an eagle in the sky

It's the way you live
in your strive-less ways
The way you live
is a goddamn waste

Seems like you've settled for the ground below
Have you, have you?
Then settle, decline, erode
While I...

While I fly,
while I soar like an eagle in the sky
I wanna fly
I wanna soar like an eagle in the sky
