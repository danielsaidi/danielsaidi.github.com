Let go
======

You always come close,
but never close enough
Distracted by your clothes
and the beating of your heart

You hold it in your hand,
afraid to let it slip
You hold it in your hand
in an tight and firm grip
When the light,
when the light goes out,
when your eyes can see no more
Trust it to bring you sight
and a soothing peace of mind

You're living for it,
living through it

Let go, my friend
Let go
