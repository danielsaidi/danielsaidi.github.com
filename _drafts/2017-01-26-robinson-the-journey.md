![Robinson: The Journey](/assets/img/blog/2017-01-26-robinson.jpg)

As it launched in October, I decided to get myself a PlayStation VR instead of a
HTC Vive. It was a judgement call that I still stand by, even though I was blown
away when I tried HTC Vive for the first time.

Having not tried out that much VR since my studies (over 10 years ago), I wanted
to evaluate the VR of today, while still not overspending, since I know that the
technology will be drastically improved over the next couple of years.

So I got myself a PlayStation VR, and was fortunate enough to also get my hands
on a pair of Move sticks early on, while most Swedish PS VR owners had to wait a
ridiculous long time for the stores to get them in stock. I have really enjoyed
the VR experiende, including games, movies and "experiences". I will write down
all my notes that I have laying around, waiting for this blog to be up.

However, the first VR post I write will be a short one about a game that I waited
