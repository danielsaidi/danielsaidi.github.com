In a [previous post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018/2018-08-26-automate-your-macbook-setup %})
from last year, I demonstrated how to setup Alamofire with object mapping, retry
handling for failing requests and a protocol driven approach to seamlessly add a
Realm cache to the mix. In this blog post, I will revisit Alamofire and recreate
the entire setup using `Codable` instead.

To keep things short(er), I will not include Realm this time around. Instead, I
will focus more on the concept of a protocol driven development process and how
you can use it to add any kind of cache implementation to the mix.


## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, I expect that you know how [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/)
work. I will use terms like `podfile` and expect that you to know what it means.







This is a walkthrough of my talk at [CocoaHeads Sthlm, April 3 2017](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuKehlKoN7o&lc=z22qu35a4xawiriehacdp435fnpjgmq2f54mjmyhi2tw03c010c.1502618893412377),
where I covered:

* Discussions about app setup and protocol-driven development
* Using `Alamofire` to fetch data from a restaurant API (Yelp)
* Using `AlamofireObjectMapper` and `ObjectMapper` to map API data to Swift objects
* Using `Realm` as a database cache, to store fetched API data
* Using Alamofire´s `RequestRetrier` to retry requests
* Using Alamofire´s `RequestAdapter` to adapt and decorate requests 
* Managing dependencies with Dependency Injection and [Dip](https://github.com/AliSoftware/Dip)

In this post, I'll recreate this entire app from scratch, with some modifications.
I will modify it to use a fake API instead of the Yelp API. More on this later.




## Source Code

I recommend you to create a blank project and work through this tutorial yourself.
The source code is up on [GitHub](https://github.com/danielsaidi/AlamofireRealmDemo).

If you want to run the demo application in the repo, you have to run `pod install`
from the demo folder, then open the `.xcworkspace` file instead of `.xcodeproj`.


## Disclaimer 

In large app projects, I prefer to extract as much code and logic as possible to
separate libraries, which I then use as decoupled building blocks. For instance,
I would keep domain logic in a domain library, which doesn't know anything about
the app. In this small project, however, I will keep the domain model in the app.

I use to separate public and private functions and any interface implementations
into extensions as well, but will skip that pattern in this demo, so that we get
as little code and conventions as possible. 


## Why use a static API?

In this demo, we will use a static API to fetch movies in different ways. The API
is a static Jekyll web with a small movie collection, that lets us grab top rated
and top grossing movies, as well as single movies by id. The api's code is in the
`gh-pages` branch of the demo repository.

If you want to have a look at the data that is returned from the API, you can use
these links:

* [Get a fake auth token](http://danielsaidi.com/AlamofireRealmDemo/api/auth)
* [Get a single movie by id](http://danielsaidi.com/AlamofireRealmDemo/api/movies/1)
* [Get top grossing movies 2016](http://danielsaidi.com/AlamofireRealmDemo/api/movies/topGrossing/2016)
* [Get top grossing movies 2016 - sorted on rating](http://danielsaidi.com/AlamofireRealmDemo/api/movies/topRated/2016)

This limited api hopefully lets us focus on Alamofire and Realm instead of having
to understand an external API, set up a developer account, handle auth logic etc.
If that sounds good to you, let's buckle up and let's go!


## Step 1 - Define the domain model

Start by creating a clean Xcode project. I went with a single page iOS storyboard
app, but you can set it up in any way you like. tvOS perhaps? :)

The app will fetch movie data from our API. A `Movie` has basic info and a `cast`
array of `Actor` objects. For simplicity, `Actor` only has a name and is used to
show how amazingly easy recursive mapping is with Alamofire.
 
To avoid an app that is coupled to a specific domain model implementation, let us
define this model as protocols. Create a `Domain` folder in the project root, add
a `Model` folder to it then add these two files to `Model`:

```swift
// Movie.swift

import Foundation

protocol Movie {
    
    var id: Int { get }
    var name: String { get }
    var year: Int { get }
    var releaseDate: Date { get }
    var grossing: Int { get }
    var rating: Double { get }
    var cast: [Actor] { get }
}
```

```swift
// Actor.swift

import Foundation

protocol Actor {
    
    var name: String { get }
}
```

As you will see later, our app will only use protocols. Not implementations. This
makes it super easy to switch out the implementations used by the app. Stay tuned.


## Step 2 - Define the domain logic

Now, let's describe how the app should fetch movies from our API. Add a `Services`
sub folder to `Domain` then add this file:

```swift
// MovieService.swift

import Foundation

typealias MovieResult = (_ movie: Movie?, _ error: Error?) -> ()
typealias MoviesResult = (_ movies: [Movie], _ error: Error?) -> ()


protocol MovieService: class {
    
    func getMovie(id: Int, completion: @escaping MovieResult)
    func getTopGrossingMovies(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult)
    func getTopRatedMovies(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult)
}
```

It took me a while to start using `typealias`, but I really like it now since it
simplifies describing async results and makes the code more readable.

This service tells us that we will be able to get movies asynchronously (well, a
completion block implies it, but doesn't enforce async). The result data for the
array functions will be indentically formatted, while the third returns a single
optional object.


## Step 3 - Create an API-specific domain model

Before we can add an API-specific implementation to the project, we must add two
`pods` to `podfile` - `Alamofire` and `AlamofireObjectMapper`. Run `pod install`,
then open the generated workspace.

Now create an `API` folder in the project root, add a `Model` folder to it, then
add these two files to `Model`:

```swift
// ApiMovie.swift

import ObjectMapper

class ApiMovie: Movie, Mappable {
    
    required public init?(map: Map) {}
    

    var id = 0
    var name = ""
    var year = 0
    var releaseDate = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
    var grossing = 0
    var rating = 0.0
    var cast: [Actor] { return _cast }
    
    private var _cast = [ApiActor]()
    
    
    func mapping(map: Map) {
        id <- map["id"]
        name <- map["name"]
        year <- map["year"]
        releaseDate <- (map["releaseDate"], DateTransform.custom)
        grossing <- map["grossing"]
        rating <- map["rating"]
        _cast <- map["cast"]
    }
}
``` 

```swift
// ApiActor.swift

import ObjectMapper

class ApiActor: Actor, Mappable {
    
    required public init?(map: Map) {}
    

    var name = ""
    

    func mapping(map: Map) {
        name <- map["name"]
    }
}
``` 

These classes implement the domain model, with additional mapping. `ApiActor` is
pretty straightforward, while `ApiMovie` can be further described:

* `releaseDate` is parsed with a DateTransform. We may have to adjust this later.

* `Movie` has an `[Actor]` array, but the mapping requires `[ApiActor]`. We thus
use a private `_cast` property for mapping and have a calculated `cast` property.

If we have set things up properly, we should now be able to point Alamofire to a
valid api url and recursively parse movie data without any effort.


## Step 4 - Setup the core API logic

Before we create an API-specific `MovieService` implementation, let's setup some
core API logic in the `API` folder.

### Managing API environments

Since we developers often have to switch between different API environments (e.g.
test and production) I use to have an enum where I manage available environments.
I know we only have a single environment in this app, but let's create it anyway:

```swift
// ApiEnvironment.swift

import Foundation

enum ApiEnvironment: String { case
    
    production = "http://danielsaidi.com/AlamofireRealmDemo/api/"
    
    var url: String {
        return rawValue
    }
}

```


### Managing API routes

With this environment in place, we can list all available routes in another enum:

```swift
// ApiRoute.swift

enum ApiRoute { case
    
    movie(id: Int),
    topGrossingMovies(year: Int),
    topRatedMovies(year: Int)
    
    var path: String {
        switch self {
        case .movie(let id): return "movies/\(id)"
        case .topGrossingMovies(let year): return "movies/topGrossing/\(year)"
        case .topRatedMovies(let year): return "movies/topRated/\(year)"
        }
    }
    
    func url(for environment: ApiEnvironment) -> String {
        return "\(environment.url)/\(path)"
    }
}
```

Since `year` and `id` are dynamic route segments, we use parametered enum cases.


### Managing API context

I usually have an `ApiContext` class that holds API-specific information for the
app, such as environment and tokens. If you use a singleton, every context-based
service will automatically be affected when the context is modified.

Let's create an `ApiContext` protocol and as a non-persisted implementation. Add
these files to a `Context` sub folder:

```swift
// ApiContext.swift

import Foundation

protocol ApiContext: class {
    
    var environment: ApiEnvironment { get set }
}
```   

```swift
// NonPersistedApiContext.swift

import Foundation

class NonPersistentApiContext: ApiContext {
    
    init(environment: ApiEnvironment) {
        self.environment = environment
    }
    
    var environment: ApiEnvironment
}
```

We can now inject this context into all out API-specific service implementations.


### Specifying basic API behavior

To simplify how to talk with the API using Alamofire, let us create a base class
for our API-based services. Add this file to a `Services` sub folder:

```swift
// AlamofireService.swift

class AlamofireService {    
    
    init(context: ApiContext) {
        self.context = context
    }
    
    
    var context: ApiContext
    
    
    func get(at route: ApiRoute, params: Parameters? = nil) -> DataRequest {
        return request(
        	at: route, 
        	method: .get, 
        	params: params, 
        	encoding: URLEncoding.default)
    }
    
    func post(at route: ApiRoute, params: Parameters? = nil) -> DataRequest {
        return request(
        	at: route, 
        	method: .post, 
        	params: params, 
        	encoding: JSONEncoding.default)
    }
    
    func put(at route: ApiRoute, params: Parameters? = nil) -> DataRequest {
        return request(
        	at: route, 
        	method: .put, 
        	params: params, 
        	encoding: JSONEncoding.default)
    }
    
    func request(at route: ApiRoute, method: HTTPMethod, params: Parameters?, encoding: ParameterEncoding) -> DataRequest {
        let url = route.url(for: context.environment)
        return Alamofire.request(
        	url, 
        	method: method, 
        	parameters: params, 
        	encoding: encoding)
        .validate()
    }
}
``` 

Restricting our services to only request `ApiRoute` ensures that the app does not
make any unspecified requests. If you need to call custom URLs, I suggest you add
a `.custom(...)` case in the `ApiRoute` enum.

Ok, that was a long preparation to setup up a good foundation for the future, but
I think that we are now ready to fetch some movies from the API.


## Step 5 - Create an API-based movie service

Let's create an API-based movie service and fetch some movies from our API, shall
we? Add this file to the `Services` sub folder, next to `AlamofireService`:

```swift
import Alamofire
import AlamofireObjectMapper

class AlamofireMovieService: AlamofireService, MovieService {
    
    func getMovie(id: Int, completion: @escaping MovieResult) {
        get(at: .movie(id: id)).responseObject {
            (res: DataResponse<ApiMovie>) in
            completion(res.result.value, res.result.error)
        }
    }
    
    func getTopGrossingMovies(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult) {
        get(at: .topGrossingMovies(year: year)).responseArray {
            (res: DataResponse<[ApiMovie]>) in
            completion(res.result.value ?? [], res.result.error)
        }
    }
    
    func getTopRatedMovies(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult) {
        get(at: .topRatedMovies(year: year)).responseArray {
            (res: DataResponse<[ApiMovie]>) in
            completion(res.result.value ?? [], res.result.error)
        }
    }
}
```

As you see, the implementation is super-simple. It just performs get requests on
the routes and specify the return type. Alamofire and AlamofireObjectMapper then
take care of fetching and mapping the returned data.

`getMovie` uses `responseObject`, while the other functions use `responseArray`.
This is because a single movie is returned as a single object while top grossing
and top rated movies are returned as arrays. If these arrays were returned in an
embedded object (very common), you would have to specify a new API-specific type
that can map that return type, then use `responseObject` with that type.


## Step 6 - Perform your very first request

We will now setup our app to fetch data from the API. Remove all the boilerplate
code from `AppDelegate` and `ViewController`, then add this to `ViewController`:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    let env = ApiEnvironment.production
    let context = NonPersistentApiContext(environment: env)
    let service = AlamofireMovieService(context: context)
    service.getTopGrossingMovies(year: 2016) { (movies, error) in
        if let error = error {
            return print(error.localizedDescription)
        }
        print("Found \(movies.count) movies:")
        movies.forEach { print("   \($0.name)") }
    }
}
```

**IMPORTANT** Before you can do this, you must allow the app to perform external
requests. Just add this to `Info.plist` (in a real world app, you should specify
the exact domains):

```xml
<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
<dict>
    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
```

Run the app. If everything is correctly setup, it should print our the following:

```
Found 10 movies:
   Finding Dory
   Rouge One - A Star Wars Story
   Captain America - Civil War
   The Secret Life of Pets
   The Jungle Book
   Deadpool
   Zootopia
   Batman v Superman - Dawn of Justice
   Suicide Squad
   Doctor Strange
```

If you see this in Xcode's log, the app loads movie data from the API. Well done!

Now change the print format for each movie to look like this:

```swift
movies.forEach { print("   \($0.name) (\($0.releaseDate))") }
```

The app should now output the following instead:

```
Found 10 movies:
   Finding Dory (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
   Rouge One - A Star Wars Story (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
   Captain America - Civil War (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
   The Secret Life of Pets (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
   The Jungle Book (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
   Deadpool (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
   Zootopia (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
   Batman v Superman - Dawn of Justice (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
   Suicide Squad (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
   Doctor Strange (1970-01-01 00:33:36 +0000)
```

Oooops! Seems like the date parsing does not work. I TOLD you that we would have
fix this...so let's fix it.


## Step 7 - Fix date parsing

The problem is that the API uses a different date format than expected. We will
solve this with a `DateTransform` extension. Place it in an `Extensions` folder:

```swift
DateTransform_Custom.swift

import ObjectMapper

public extension DateTransform {
    
    public static var custom: DateFormatterTransform {
        let formatter = DateFormatter()
        formatter.dateFormat = "yyyy-MM-dd"
        formatter.timeZone = TimeZone(secondsFromGMT: 0)
        return DateFormatterTransform(dateFormatter: formatter)
    }
}
```

Now change the `releaseDate` mapping in the `ApiMovie` class to look like this:

```swift
releaseDate <- (map["releaseDate"], DateTransform.custom)
```

Problem solved! The app should now output the following instead:

```
Found 10 movies:
   Finding Dory (2016-06-17 00:00:00 +0000)
   Rouge One - A Star Wars Story (2016-12-16 00:00:00 +0000)
   Captain America - Civil War (2016-05-06 00:00:00 +0000)
   The Secret Life of Pets (2016-07-08 00:00:00 +0000)
   The Jungle Book (2016-04-15 00:00:00 +0000)
   Deadpool (2016-02-12 00:00:00 +0000)
   Zootopia (2016-03-04 00:00:00 +0000)
   Batman v Superman - Dawn of Justice (2016-03-25 00:00:00 +0000)
   Suicide Squad (2016-08-05 00:00:00 +0000)
   Doctor Strange (2016-11-05 00:00:00 +0000)
```

If you inspect the other properties, you will see that they are correctly parsed
as well. Time to celebrate! ...then return here for some database persistency.


## Step 8 - Create a Realm-specific domain model

When you get data from an API, it does not hurt to cache some data in a database
cache. A very convenient database engine is `Realm`, so let's try it out.

Add a `Realm` folder to the application root, then add a `Model` and a `Services`
folder to it. Now, let's create...wait! Before we can use Realm, we have to grab
it from CocoaPods. Add `RealmSwift` to the `podfile`, then add this bottommost:

```
post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
            config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '3.0'
        end
    end
end
```

After running `pod install`, we can now create some Realm-specific model classes.
They will either be created manually as we map and persist data from the API, or
automatically as we fetch data from the database.

Realm will take care of the latter case, but we have to find a way to easily map
API objects to Realm objects. That is easily done. Add these files to the `Model`
folder:

```swift
// RealmMovie.swift

import RealmSwift

class RealmMovie: Object, Movie {
    
    convenience required public init(copy obj: Movie) {
        self.init()
        id = obj.id
        name = obj.name
        year = obj.year
        releaseDate = obj.releaseDate
        grossing = obj.grossing
        rating = obj.rating
        _cast.append(contentsOf: obj.cast.map { RealmActor(copy: $0) })
    }
    

    dynamic var id = 0
    dynamic var name = ""
    dynamic var year = 0
    dynamic var releaseDate = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
    dynamic var grossing = 0
    dynamic var rating = 0.0
    var cast: [Actor] { return Array(_cast) }
    
    var _cast = List<RealmActor>()


    override class func primaryKey() -> String? {
        return "id"
    }
}
```

```swift
// RealmActor.swift

import RealmSwift

class RealmActor: Object, Actor {
    
    convenience required public init(copy obj: Actor) {
        self.init()
        name = obj.name
    }
    

    dynamic var name = ""
    

    override class func primaryKey() -> String? {
        return "name"
    }
}
```

Both classes inherit `Realm`'s `Object` class and have a convenience initializer
that copies properties from another instance of the protocol they implement.

Like in the API model, `RealmActor` is pretty straightforward, while `RealmMovie`
is more complex. It has a private `_cast` property, which is used as the backing
value for `cast`. `_cast` is a Realm `List<RealmActor>`, while `cast` is a Swift
`[Actor]`, just like in the protocol.


## Step 9 - Create a Realm-specific movie service

Now let's add a Realm-specific `MovieService` that lets us store movies from the
API to Realm. Add this file to the `Services` folder:

```swift
// RealmMovieService.swift

import RealmSwift

class RealmMovieService: MovieService {
    
    init(baseService: MovieService) {
        self.baseService = baseService
    }
    
    
    fileprivate let baseService: MovieService
    
    fileprivate var realm: Realm { return try! Realm() }
    
    
    func getMovie(id: Int, completion: @escaping MovieResult) {
        getMovieFromDb(id: id, completion: completion)
        getMovieFromService(id: id, completion: completion)
    }
    
    func getTopGrossingMovies(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult) {
        getTopGrossingMoviesFromDb(year: year, completion: completion)
        getTopGrossingMoviesFromService(year: year, completion: completion)
    }
    
    func getTopRatedMovies(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult) {
        getTopRatedMoviesFromDb(year: year, completion: completion)
        getTopRatedMoviesFromService(year: year, completion: completion)
    }
    
    
    fileprivate func getMovieFromDb(id: Int, completion: @escaping MovieResult) {
        let obj = realm.object(ofType: RealmMovie.self, forPrimaryKey: id)
        completion(obj, nil)
    }
    
    fileprivate func getMovieFromService(id: Int, completion: @escaping MovieResult) {
        baseService.getMovie(id: id) { (movie, error) in
            self.persist(movie)
            completion(movie, error)
        }
    }
    
    fileprivate func getTopGrossingMoviesFromDb(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult) {
        let objs = realm.objects(RealmMovie.self).filter("year == \(year)")
        let sorted = objs.sorted { $0.grossing > $1.grossing }
        completion(Array(sorted), nil)
    }
    
    fileprivate func getTopGrossingMoviesFromService(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult) {
        baseService.getTopGrossingMovies(year: year) {  (movies, error) in
            self.persist(movies)
            completion(movies, error)
        }
    }
    
    fileprivate func getTopRatedMoviesFromDb(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult) {
        let objs = realm.objects(RealmMovie.self).filter("year == \(year)")
        let sorted = objs.sorted { $0.rating > $1.rating }
        completion(Array(sorted), nil)
    }
    
    fileprivate func getTopRatedMoviesFromService(year: Int, completion: @escaping MoviesResult) {
        baseService.getTopRatedMovies(year: year) {  (movies, error) in
            self.persist(movies)
            completion(movies, error)
        }
    }
    
    fileprivate func persist(_ movie: Movie?) {
        guard let movie = movie else { return }
        persist([movie])
    }
    
    fileprivate func persist(_ movies: [Movie]) {
        let objs = movies.map { RealmMovie(copy: $0) }
        try! realm.write {
            realm.add(objs, update: true)
        }
    }
}
```

As you can see, `RealmMovieService`'s initializer requires another `MovieService`
instance. Why is that?

`RealmMovieService` is a so called `decorator`, which uses a base implementation
of a protocol it implements, to extend the base implementation with its on logic.
In this case, our `baseService` is an `AlamofireMovieService`, but the decorator
shouldn't care about how the base service works, just what the protocol promises.

In this case, `RealmMovieService` will try to get data from the database, but at
the same time, it will also try to get data from the base service. When the base
service completes, `RealmMovieService` saves any data it receives. It then calls
the incoming completion block, to notify its caller about the new data.

`Disclaimer:` This is an intentionally simple design. `RealmMovieService` always
loads data from the database **and** from the base service. In a real app, you'd
probably have some logic to determine if calling the base service is needed.


## Step 10 - Put Realm into action

Let's give whatever we have now a try. Modify `viewDidLoad` to look like this:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    let env = ApiEnvironment.production
    let context = NonPersistentApiContext(environment: env)
    let baseService = AlamofireMovieService(context: context)
    let service = RealmMovieService(baseService: baseService)
    var invokeCount = 0
    service.getTopGrossingMovies(year: 2016) { (movies, error) in
        invokeCount += 1
        if let error = error {
            print("ERROR: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } else {
            print("Found \(movies.count) movies (callback #\(invokeCount))")
        }
    }
}
```

In the code above, we rename the Alamofire service to `baseService`, then create
a Realm service into which we inject `baseService`. The app is still loading top
grossing movies using a `service` instance, but this time the service will first
check the database, then call the API. However, the app does not care about this.
It only cares about the protocol, not how it is implemented.

The output will be the following, the first time we run the app with this setup:

```
Found 0 movies  (callback #1)
Found 10 movies (callback #2)
```

This happens because the database has no data, while the API will load 10 movies.
If you run the app again, the output should be:

```
Found 10 movies (callback #1)
Found 10 movies (callback #2)
```

This happens because the database now has data, which means that both completion
calls will return 10 movies.

Now, go ahead and **KILL THE INTERNET CONNECTION**, then call `getTopRatedMovies`
instead of `getTopGrossingMovies` (Alamofire will cache the previous result). If
you run the app again, the output should be:

```
Found 10 movies (callback #1)
ERROR: The Internet connection appears to be offline.
```

This happens because the database data can still be loaded, while the API cannot
be called since the Internet connection is dead.

We now have an app with offline support, that only refreshes its data whenever a
call to the API provides the app with new data. All we had to do was to change a
single line in the view controller, to use another service implementation.


## Step 11 - Retry failing requests

In the real world, a user most often has to authenticate her/himself in order to
use some parts of an API. Authentication often returns a set of tokens, commonly
an `auth token` and a `refresh token` (but how this works is up to the API).

If the `auth token` and `refresh token` pattern is used, the authentication flow
could look something like this:

* If no auth token is available and the request fails with a 401, the app should
show a login screen, since the user has to login.

* If an auth token is available, the app can try to call the API with that token.

* If an auth token is available, but the requests fail with a 401, the token may
have expired. The app should use the refresh token to request new tokens.

* If the refresh succeeds, the app will have new tokens and should automatically
retry all previously failed requests.

* If the refresh fails, the app should logout the user and show a login screen.

Alamofire 4 makes this kind of logic **super simple** to implement, since it has
a `RequestRetrier` protocol that we can implement and inject into Alamofire. The
retrier will be notified about all failing requests, and lets you determine if a
request should be retried or not, and if so how it should be retried.

We will demonstrate this by faking a failing auth. First, add an `auth` route to
`ApiRoute`, and have it return `auth` as path. Our static API will always return
the same "auth token" when this route is called.

Second, add this file to `Domain/Services`:

```swift
// AuthService.swift

import Foundation

typealias AuthResult = (_ token: String?, _ error: Error?) -> ()


protocol AuthService: class {

    func authorizeApplication(completion: @escaping AuthResult)
}
``` 

This is a really simple protocol that defines how the app is to authorize itself.
Before we implement it, we have to add a way to store any auth tokens we receive.

`Disclaimer:` As an app grows, I find it easier to separate the app into context
related parts instead of class types. In other words, instead of the `Model` and
`Services` grouping, the app should probably benefit from grouping the code into
`Movies` and `Authentication` groups instead, where each group could contain all
related functionality for that group, like views, extensions etc.

Ok, back to storing auth tokens. Remember what I told you about the `ApiContext`
earlier? Well, it's a **PERFECT** place to store these tokens, so let's do just
that. Add an `authToken` property to the `ApiContext` protocol:

```swift
var authToken: String? { get set }
```

Also, add the property to `NonPersistentApiContext` (if we had a persistent one,
it would remember the auth token even if restarted the app):

```swift
var authToken: String?
```

Now, let's add an Alamofire-based `AuthService` implementation to `Api/Services`:


```swift
// AlamofireAuthService.swift

import Alamofire
import AlamofireObjectMapper

class AlamofireAuthService: AlamofireService, AuthService {
    
    func authorizeApplication(completion: @escaping AuthResult) {
        get(at: .auth).responseString {
            (res: DataResponse<String>) in
            if let token = res.result.value {
                self.context.authToken = token
            }
            completion(res.result.value, res.result.error)
        }
    }
}
``` 

If the API request above succeeds, the token is saved in our context. This will
make it available to all future API requests.

Now, let's retry some requests! Add this file to the `Api` folder:

```swift
import Alamofire

class ApiRequestRetrier: RequestRetrier {
    
    init(context: ApiContext, authService: AuthService) {
        self.context = context
        self.authService = authService
    }
    
    
    fileprivate let authService: AuthService
    fileprivate let context: ApiContext
    fileprivate var isAuthorizing = false
    fileprivate var retryQueue = [RequestRetryCompletion]()
    
    
    func should(
        _ manager: SessionManager,
        retry request: Request,
        with error: Error,
        completion: @escaping RequestRetryCompletion) {
        
        guard
            shouldRetryRequest(with: request.request?.url),
            shouldRetryResponse(with: request.response?.statusCode)
            else { return completion(false, 0) }
        
        authorize(with: completion)
    }
    
    
    fileprivate func authorize(with completion: @escaping RequestRetryCompletion) {
        print("Authorizing application...")
        retryQueue.append(completion)
        guard !isAuthorizing else { return }
        isAuthorizing = true
        authService.authorizeApplication { (token, error) in
            self.printAuthResult(token, error)
            self.isAuthorizing = false
            self.context.authToken = token
            let success = token != nil
            self.retryQueue.forEach { $0(success, 0) }
            self.retryQueue.removeAll()
        }
    }

    fileprivate func printAuthResult(_ token: String?, _ error: Error?) {
        if let error = error {
            return print("Authorizing failed: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        } 
        if let token = token {
            return print("Authorizing succeded: \(token)")
        } 
        print("No token received - failing!")
    }

    fileprivate func shouldRetryRequest(with url: URL?) -> Bool {
        guard let url = url?.absoluteString else { return false }
        let authPath = ApiRoute.auth.path
        return !url.contains(authPath)
    }
    
    fileprivate func shouldRetryResponse(with statusCode: Int?) -> Bool {
        return true // statusCode == 401
    }
}

```

Whenever a request fails, Alamofire will ask the retrier if it should be retried.
The retrier will trigger a retry if the request is not a failing auth (read more
about the commented out 401 later down). If not, it just lets the request fail.

If a request should be retried, it's added it to a retry queue. The retrier then
triggers an authorization. Once it completes, the retrier checks if it succeeded.
If so, all queued requests are retried. If not, all queued requests fail and the
retry queue is cleared.

Note that this is completely hidden from the user as well as the app itself. The
retrier works under the hood, tightly connected to Alamofire's internal workings.
It just notifies the app if the authorization fails, by failing all requests.

Inject the retrier into `Alamofire` by adding the following to our `viewDidLoad`
(note that you have to add `import Alamofire` topmost as well):

```
let manager = SessionManager.default
manager.retrier = ApiRequestRetrier(context: context, authService: authService)
```

**IMPORTANT**  In the real world, a 401 status code is an indication that tokens
should be refreshed. If this refresh fails, a 401 indicates that the user has to
log in, since the tokens are invalid. Here, however, we will never receive a 401.
We therefore have to trigger these mechanisms by doing the following:

* Kill the Internet connection and perform a clean install, so that the app does
not have any cached data.

* Add a breakpoint to the `authService.authorizeApplication` call in the retrier.

* Run the app. The app should now fail the request and activate this breakpoint.

* Bring the Internet connection back online and resume the app. This should make
the authorization call succeed and have Alamofire successfully retry the request.

That's it! Alamofire should now retry any failing request that are not auth ones.


## Step 12 - Adapt all Alamofire requests

Sometimes, you have to add custom headers to every request you make to an API. A
common scenario is to add `Accept` information, auth tokens etc.

To adapt any Alamofire requests before they are sent, you just have to implement
the `RequestAdapter` protocol and inject it into Alamofire. Add this file to the
`Api` folder:

```swift
// ApiRequestAdapter.swift

import Alamofire

class ApiRequestAdapter: RequestAdapter {
    
    public init(context: ApiContext) {
        self.context = context
    }
    
    
    fileprivate let context: ApiContext
    
    
    func adapt(_ request: URLRequest) throws -> URLRequest {
        guard let token = context.authToken else { return request }
        var request = request
        request.setValue(token, forHTTPHeaderField: "AUTH_TOKEN")
        return request
    }
}
```

As you can see, this adapter just adds any existing token to the request headers.
Inject it into `Alamofire` by adding the following to our `viewDidLoad`:

```swift
manager.adapter = ApiRequestAdapter(context: context)
```

That's it! Alamofire should now add the auth token to all requests, if it exists.


## Step 13 - Dependency Injection

Well, I won't do this here, since it just add even more complexity to an already
super-long tutorial. In the demo application, however, I have an `IoC` folder in
which I use a library called [Dip](https://github.com/AliSoftware/Dip) to manage
dependencies in the app. With IoC/DI in place, the view controller becomes clean:

```swift
import UIKit
import Alamofire

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        reloadData(self)
    }
    
    
    lazy var movieService: MovieService = IoC.resolve()
    
    
    fileprivate var movies = [Movie]()
    
    
    @IBOutlet weak var tableView: UITableView? {
        didSet {
            tableView?.delegate = self
            tableView?.dataSource = self
        }
    }
    
    @IBOutlet weak var dataPicker: UISegmentedControl?
    
    
    @IBAction func reloadData(_ sender: Any) {
        let index = dataPicker?.selectedSegmentIndex ?? 0
        index == 0
            ? movieService.getTopGrossingMovies(year: 2016, completion: moviesCompletion)
            : movieService.getTopRatedMovies(year: 2016, completion: moviesCompletion)
    }
    
    fileprivate func moviesCompletion(_ movies: [Movie], _ error: Error?) {
        if let error = error { fatalError(error.localizedDescription) }
        self.movies = movies
        self.tableView?.reloadData()
    }
}

extension ViewController: UITableViewDataSource, UITableViewDelegate {
    
    func numberOfSections(in tableView: UITableView) -> Int {
        return 1
    }
    
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, numberOfRowsInSection section: Int) -> Int {
        return movies.count
    }
    
    func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, cellForRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) -> UITableViewCell {
        let cell = tableView.dequeueReusableCell(withIdentifier: "Cell", for: indexPath)
        let movie = movies[indexPath.row]
        let names = movie.cast.map { $0.name }
        cell.textLabel?.text = "\(movie.name) (\(movie.year))"
        cell.detailTextLabel?.text = names.joined(separator: ", ")
        return cell
    }
}
```

The result looks like this:

And...


## That's a wrap!

Well done! You have created an app with abstract protocols, then added Alamofire,
object mapping and Realm to the mix. You have also added request retry and adapt
logic using the `RequestRetrier` and `RequestAdapter` protocols. Wow!

I hope this was helpful. Do not hesistate to throw your thoughts and ideas at me.

All the best
