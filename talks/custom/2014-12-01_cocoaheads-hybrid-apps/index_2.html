					<section data-markdown>
						## What is a hybrid app?
						### (according to me)

						- - - 

						Installs on the device

						Mixes native and web

						Native can interact with web

						Web can interact with native

						HTML is embedded or requested
					</section>
					<!--<section data-markdown>
						## What is a hybrid app NOT?
						### (according to me)

						- - - 

						Isolated web pages in a native app

						Web application that runs in a browser

						No interaction between native and web
					</section>-->
					<section data-markdown>
						## Native apps

						- - - 

						### Pros

						**Required** for some apps

						Fast, reliable & responsive
						
						Ideal, if your budget allows it

						- - - 

						### Cons

						Platform specific *

						Increased complexity
						
						Development, developers

						OS updates, releases, certificates etc.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Web apps

						- - - 

						### Pros

						HTML5
						
						Easy to develop
						
						Updates on the fly

						Platform independent

						- - - 

						### Cons

						Slow, unresponsive

						Uncanny valley

						Internet connection is (often) a must
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Hybrid apps should
						### embrace the good stuff of both
						### and minimize the bad stuff of both

						# Case Study
						## Tradera Labs
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## Background

						I joined Tradera in May 2013

						Apps by a 3rd party agency

						Slow and frustrating implementation

						Frequent crashes, bugs, functions missing

						Bad reviews in the App Store
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Enter: A-Team

						We take over the apps in August 2013

						Me on iOS, a contractor on Android

						Fix bugs, add requested features

						Challenging, but worked well

						Better reviews in the App Store
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## However...

						Intense work on tradera.com

						The apps had miles to go to catch up

						The team had to focus on other stuff

						So, no app work since December 2013
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Discussions

						Should the apps evolve...

						...or should we replace them?

						Should we have an inhouse team...

						...or an external partner?

						Should Tradera even have apps?
					</section>
				</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						# Wait!
						## What about a hybrid app?
					</section>	

					<section data-markdown>
						## The experiment

						In May, we decided to give it a try

						I had 6 weeks to build a hybrid PoC

						Wrap the new, responsive web site

						Make the app as simple as possible

						Ideally, a web developer should be able to work on it

						Every line of native code must have a reason to exist
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Questions to answer

						Could we just embed the web site?

						How much native code will we need?

						How fast and responsive can the app be?

						How much future work will the app require?

						What benefits will it provide, what do we lose?

						**Deliberate tradeoff** - what will our users think?
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Pros

						If successful, it could replace the old apps

						Our amazing backend developers can work on it

						New features available without having to update

						Build new features once, then use them everywhere

						Consistent UI, uniform statistics, improved experiments

						- - - 

						...and we can still use as much native stuff as we need.
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Cons

						Increased load on our servers 

						HTML loads slower than native views

						New bugs are immediately available as well

						External resources (ads) may affect the app

						The hybrid may minit what we can do on the web

						New features must be even more thoroughly tested
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Focus

						Ensure loose coupling

						The web must be able to configure the app

						The web must be able to customize UI for the app

						The app must have minimum knowledge of the web

						The app must be able to have a slower release cycle

						The app and web must be able to scale independently
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						# Results 

						## and learnings
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						## How did it go?

						First App Store release after 3 weeks

						Many flaws and missing features

						Memory problems, frequent crashes

						- - - 

						Most problems fixed during autumn

						e-mail feedback is mostly positive

						App Store reviews are terrible
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## How does it work?

						Native navigation bar and side menu

						These sections have a web view each

						The app identifies itself with **custom headers**

						New views are pushed to the **navigation stack**

						The web exposes **configuration data** to the app

						The web communicates events through **url schemes**
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Custom headers

						Sent for each request, if config not says otherwise

						Headers must **not** be sent to certain external pages

						Headers include OS, app version & build, device type

						This gives the web all it needs to know about the app
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Navigation

						Much effort put on the navigation experience

						Much effort put on memory management as well

						Creating a web view for each new view is expensive

						Configurable stack cache in case of memory warnings

						Return to previously displayed views whenever possible
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Configuration data

						Embedded as a data blog in each response

						Tells the hybrid app everything it needs to know

						Defines behavior, scripts, platform specific info etc.

						Also includes user id, alias, login status

						The app should be *configured* more than *developed*
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## URLs and events

						The app can display any tradera.com URL

						This makes our custom url scheme powerful

						It also makes our open url approach awesome

						Events from the web are communicated through urls
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Conclusion
						### The good

						The app is fast (for a hybrid)

						The app is responsive (for a hybrid)

						The loose coupling works really well

						The configuration data works great

						Notifications, badges, extensions etc.

						- - - 

						People are generally happy with the hybrid
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Conclusion
						### The bad

						The navigation stack is memory intensive

						Heap related crashes are hard to solve

						Some parts **still** displays the OLD Tradera site

						- - - 

						**Organizational challenges**

						When do we prioritize an experiment?

						How do we involve developers early on?

						And what about cred, problems, ownership?
					</section>
					<section data-markdown>
						## Conclusion
						### Native app vs. hybrid app

						The native app was simple

						Still, it had a lot of bugs

						Also, it lacked a lot of features

						- - - 

						The hybrid app has a lot of features

						Still, key features are harder to access

						Still...it can naturally be done
